Steps of a Multi-turn Dialog or Conversation
The questions Alexa asks during the conversation fall into three categories:

Slot elicitation: Ask the user for a slot value. The user answers with a slot value or a full utterance including the slot value. Examples of slot elicitation questions:
Alexa: What city are you leaving from? (Eliciting the value for a fromCity slot.)
Slot confirmation: Ask the user to confirm that a single slot value previously provided (or set programmatically) is correct. The user answers with "yes" or "no". Examples of slot confirmation questions:
Alexa: You said you're leaving from Seattle, right? (Confirming the fromCity value.)
Intent confirmation: Ask the user to verify that all the information gathered for the intent is correct before fulfilling the intent. As with slot confirmation, the user answers with "yes" or "no". Examples of intent confirmation questions:
Alexa: I'm saving your trip from Seattle to Portland on April 21st. Is that OK? (Confirming the entire PlanMyTrip intent.)

Thanks Rachel,

That's a big relief that my documents have been traced. This is unfortunate that documents have been received on 5th July but processing has just started.

can you please let me know when can I expect a decision on this?

Best Regards,

• Why Voice Assistants?
• Voice Assistants
• Why Alexa?
• Alexa Devices
• Alexa Skill

Why Voice Assistants?

• Conversation is the most natural way to interact with devices
• Bridging human and technology
• Personalization
• Enhanced productivity
• Enable people to use technology in a more simple way

Other Voice Assistants
Amazon Alexa
	Multiple Devices & Third party devices
	Many Skills : Most skills at the moment
	Open SDK / REST API
	Business integration : No other options gives this facility
Google Assistant : Only google devices, intermediate skills
Apple SiriKit
MS Cortana

Why Alexa 
• Integrated with multiple smart speakers and apps
• Large platform & user base
• Many custom skills (25000 in Dec 2017)
• Open SDK (e.g. Node.js, Java)
• REST API
• Simple to integrate
• Business integration (Deployment / Custom skills)

Alexa Devices
• Amazon Echo Family (e.g. Echo, Echo Dot, etc…)
• Amazon Fire Family (e.g. Fire TV, Fire Tablets, etc…)
• Third party devices (e.g. Sonos, HP, many more…)
• Features:
	• Always on, always connected, hands free device
	• Continually learns and adapts to your speech patterns
	• Echo has 7 microphones & Can hear you across a room
	• Just say wake up word: “Alexa”

How Alexa skills work 

Wake Word : What Alexa "listens to" before taking an action. In most cases it will be Alexa 
Skill : “App” for Alexa, Complete list of Alexa Skills can be found on the “Alexa Skills Store”
Invocation Name : Trigger word for skill
Utterance : What follows an invocation to determine intent
Intent : What user is requesting / function to perform based on the utterance
Slot : Slots are like “parameters” or “variables”


Create an invocation name. This is the word or phrase that users will speak to activate the skill.

Now we will add a Custom Slot Type.
Alexa is Amazon’s voice service 
skills that simplify everyday tasks
Think of all the different ways that a user could request to make a specific intent happen.
one-shot utterance s

synonyms
Skill name : What we will see in the console/catalogue
Invocation name is what the user have to say to trigger the skill, start the skill or use the skill
Intent : Intention of the end user, what the user trying to achieve. get me order count, create test order, get me order status. By default three built-in intents has added, stop, help and cancel. Standard across all skills. Consistent across all skills.
Slot : variable, argument
Slot Types 
Utterance : Phrase user will says to trigger the intent, ways to express intents

7+ utterances , amif for 30+

build model : actual starts the machine learning process

Don't judge me just spend few hours to build this.
