RAC

At the heart of Oracle RAC is a shared disk subsystem. All nodes in the cluster must be able to access all of the data, redo log files, control files and parameter files for all nodes in the cluster. The data disks must be globally available to allow all nodes to access the database. Each node has its own redo log and control files but the other nodes must be able to access them in order to recover that node in the event of a system failure.



A Real Application Cluster is highly available and scalable. The failure of one node in the cluster
does not affect client sessions or the availability of the cluster itself until the last node in the
cluster fails; the only impact a lost node has on the cluster is a slight degradation in response
time

A RAC database has a few disadvantages. Licensing costs are higher, because each node in
the cluster has to have its own Oracle license. The close physical proximity of the nodes in the
cluster due to the high-speed requirements of the cluster interconnect means that a natural disaster
can take out the entire cluster;

Software Configuration
Cluster Ready Services (CRS) is the clustering solution that can be used on
all major platforms instead of an OS vendor or third-party clusterware.
CRS is installed before the RDBMS and must be in its own home directory, referred to as the
CRS_HOME. If you are only using a single instance in the near future but plan to cluster at a later
date, it is useful to install CRS first so that the components of CRS that are needed for ASM and
RAC are in the RDBMS directory structure. If you do not install CRS first, you will have to perform
some extra steps later to remove the CRS-related process executables from the RDBMS home
directory.

After CRS is installed, you install the database software in the home directory, referred to as
the ORACLE_HOME. On some platforms, such as Microsoft Windows, this directory can be a
directory common to all nodes, whereas other platforms, such as Linux, require OCFS version
2.x or later. Otherwise, each node will have its own copy of the binary executables.

Network Configuration
Each node in a RAC has a minimum of three IP addresses: one for the public network, one for the
private network interconnect, and a virtual IP address to support faster failover in the event of a
node failure. As a result, a minimum of two physical network cards are required to support RAC;
additional network cards are used to provide redundancy on the public network and thus an
alternate network path for incoming connections. For the private network, additional network
cards can boost performance by providing more total bandwidth for interconnect traffic.

There are five raw disks that are 512MB in size reserved for the voting disk, the OCR disk,
and their mirrors (one mirror for the OCR disk and two mirrors for the voting disk);
The shared file system /u01 uses
Oracle Cluster File System (OCFS2) to share the Oracle executable files among all nodes in the
cluster, saving installation time and duplication of the same Oracle executables on each node in
the cluster.

Oracle Enterprise Linux bundles many features not automatically
available with the corresponding Red Hat distributions, such as
OCFS2 and the ASMlib library. More importantly, Oracle Enterprise
Linux is supported and tightly integrated with Oracle Unbreakable
Linux, a support program for Oracle on Linux solutions through
Oracle MetaLink.

On each node, the Oracle software will reside in a shared ORACLE_HOME; the database and
recovery files will use ASM disks configured with Oracle ASMLib, and the OCR and voting disks
will use raw devices.
