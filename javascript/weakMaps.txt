A Map is an unordered list of key-value pairs where the key and the value can be of any type like string, boolean, number, etc.
In a Weak Map, every key can only be an object and function. It used to store weak object references.

Maps are iterable.	WeakMaps are not iterable.
Maps have some properties : .set, .get, .delete, .size, .has, .forEach, Iterators.
WeakMaps have some properties : .set, .get, .delete, .has.

//Create a WeakMap using the provided variables as keys.
//Set the value to whatever term you think of when you hear
//those cities. The value can be anything. Hint: use set()
