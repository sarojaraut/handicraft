Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in that string.

console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5

Remember that methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true
