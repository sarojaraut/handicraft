Set
A Set is a special type collection – “set of values” (without keys), where each value may occur only once.

Its main methods are:

new Set([iterable]) – creates the set, and if an iterable object is provided (usually an array), copies values from it into the set.
set.add(value) – adds a value, returns the set itself.
set.delete(value) – removes the value, returns true if value existed at the moment of the call, otherwise false.
set.has(value) – returns true if the value exists in the set, otherwise false.
set.clear() – removes everything from the set.
set.size – is the elements count.

let set = new Set();

let john = { name: "John" };
let pete = { name: "Pete" };
let mary = { name: "Mary" };

// visits, some users come multiple times
set.add(john);
set.add(pete);
set.add(mary);
set.add(john);
set.add(mary);

for (let user of set) {
  console.log(user.name); // John (then Pete and Mary)
}

Iteration over Set
We can loop over a set either with for..of or using forEach:

set.forEach((value, valueAgain, set) => console.log(value.name));

let set = new Set(["oranges", "apples", "bananas"]);


//Create a Set using the letters guessed thus far.

let guessedLetters = new Set(['r', 's', 't', 'l', 'n', 'e']);

//2. Your friend takes another guess: p. Before you add it to the set check
//to see if the Set has 'p'. If not, add it to the Set.
alreadyGuessed = guessedLetters.has('p');

guessedLetters.add('p');

//3. At this point, we will assume your friend hasn't tried to guess the same letter twice.
//The size of the Set will indicate how many guesses he's made. How many guesses
//has your friend made?
guessedLetters.size;

//4. Delete the letter 'l' from your Set.
guessedLetters.delete('l');

//5. What is the second value in your Set?
letters = guessedLetters.values();
letters.next();
letters.next().value;
//6. What is the first entry in your Set?
const guessesEntries = guesses.entries();
const firstEntry = guessesEntries.next().value;

//7. For each entry in your Set, log out whether the guess was a consonant or a vowel.
//This one is a little challenging!
const vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];

//8. Clear your Set!

guessedLetters.clear();
console.log("Checking size to make sure", guessedLetters.size);
