Eye Care

Nourish your eyes with eye foods like carrots, apricots and blueberries. All these foods are rich in beta-carotene and are good for your eyes.
Once in a week dab some essential oil like jasmine or massage your head with coconut oil on your head. This will help to increase the beta waves in your front brain, which will enhance wakefulness and enable you to focus better.
Steam it or saute, but make sure to add spinach to your diet at its maximum. Spinach is loaded with lutein and various other nutrients, which can helps to prevent many eye related problems like cataracts and blurry vision.
If you feel that your eyes are strained, go to the washroom and wash your eyes thoroughly. Make this a daily habit. Splashing your eyes with water will help to relieve your eyes from excessive stress and make them fresh.
Eating eggs will help you to load your body with lutein and zeaxanthin, which helps to promote sharp vision and reduce age-related eye diseases, which can cause blindness.
Never let the air-conditioned air from your car or your office suck all the moisture from your eyes. Always vent down your A/C panel downwards or away from your face. Air conditioner air can cause serious dryness, which can further cause blindness or any other cornea disorder.
Water is the best remedy for all your problems. Keep sipping lots of water at regular intervals, because a less frequent blurry vision can be due to dehydration.
Since we spent most of the time starring at close objects, adopt a habit of looking at distant things. Try looking at distant objects in your surrounding while walking or sitting.
Performing relaxation exercises like placing your hands together, palm to palm and rubbing them to create some heat and placing them on your eyes is a great method to avoid eyestrain. Another great way to relax your eyes is by shutting your eyes and imagining something you like it can be a place, clothes or your wonderland.
Adding fish to your diet at least once to twice a week, is the best way to avoid dry-eye syndrome, as fishes are loaded with Omega 3 fatty acids.
Constantly blinking your eyes is a very simple way to keep your eyes fresh and avoid eyestrain. Computer users tend to blink their eyes very less, thus it is recommended that they should follow the exercise of blinking their eyes every three-four seconds.
