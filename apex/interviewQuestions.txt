What is Oracle Application Express? 
Oracle Application Express (APEX formerly called as HTML DB) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features. Developers claim to build web application 10x faster and with 100x less code compared to traditional hand coding using popular java script frameworks.

There are numerous complexities involved in developing a modern web application, including security, accessibility, efficient data access, performance, and globalization. hese are typically addressed by hand written code. 
Oracle APEX enables you to focus on your business problem by eliminating this burden and providing world-class components, a deeply customizable user interface, native web service integration, and a whole lot more, out of the box.

Various components provided are : faceted search, interactive grid, interactive report, charting and dashboards, data entry forms, master detail form, calenders, navigation menu, webservice access. All these can be built and customised in a declarative manner. 

Oracle APEX components are rigorously tested for usability, accessibility, performance, and security, out of the box. No coding required.

Using APEX, developers can quickly develop and deploy compelling apps that solve real problems and provide immediate value. You won't need to be an expert in a vast array of technologies to deliver sophisticated solutions. Focus on solving the problem and let APEX take care of the rest.

Archiecture :

Oracle APEX uses a database encapsulated simple metadata-driven architecture that provides fast data access, top performance, and scalability, out of the box.

Oracle APEX uses a simple 3-tier architecture where requests are sent from the browser, through a web server, to the database. All processing, data manipulation and business logic is executed in the database. This architecture guarantees zero latency data access, top performance, and scalability, out of the box.

browser <-> ords <-> Oracle DB with Apex 

Oracle  REST Data Services (ORDS) : ORDS is a Java application that enables developers with SQL and database skills to develop REST APIs for Oracle Database. It acts as a web listner for APEX

Metadata Driven

When you create or extend an application, Oracle APEX creates or modifies the metadata stored in its database tables. When the application is run, the Oracle APEX engine then reads the metadata and displays the requested page or processes page submissions.

To provide stateful behavior within an application, Oracle APEX transparently manages session state in the database. Application developers can get and set session state using simple substitutions as well as standard SQL bind variable syntax. 

All processing is performed by PL/SQL acting directly on the data schemas in the database. Therefore, Oracle APEX apps are very efficient as data is manipulated directly in the database, and the results are sent back to your web browser. A single API call invokes all of the necessary data processing, based on the metadata definition, in a single request rather than requiring multiple calls to the database.

Stateless Access

Oracle APEX is vastly scalable and can support tens of thousands of concurrent users due to the manner in which it manages database requests. The API calls to the Oracle APEX engine use the standard Oracle database connection pool. This means that once an API call is processed and the response sent back to the browser, the connection used is returned to the database connection pool, and can be used by any other request.

The database sessions are only active when performing a request, otherwise, the users' session is inactive and does not consume any database resources. 

What are the uses of APEX?
    Builds professional looking web applications that are both fast and secure.
    Runs on and lives in Oracle database. APEX framework and meta data are stored in Oracle tables.
    Deployment of application is as simple as ‘Export and Import’ if hard coded references of values that change between environments are avoided.
    Lot of scope for customization of application look and feel.
    Scalable for high user volume. ASKTOM, former ORACLE METALINK (before migrated to Flash version) and MANY APPLICATIONS are built using APEX.
    Can be configured to use Oracle SSO and EBS fnd user repository.

By which user we connect to apex application?
apex_public_user

How APEX Architecture works?
APEX is installed on Oracle database.
At the time of installation it creates several schamas and stored apex objects in those scehmas.
Objects comprises of meta data in tables, pl/sql code and extensive JavaScript APIs.
When we create workspace, users and applications details are stored in the metadata tables.
When we create build new applications app metadata is stored in the corresponding tables and when we run the application 
The URL request from the browser is translated into appropriate APEX PL/SQL call by ords. After the data is processed, results are relayed back to browser as HTML. This cycle happens each time user request or submit a page. The application session state is maintained in database tables.

What are versions of APEX you have worked with?
4.0 - dynamic action, plug-in support and restful webservices 
5.0 - new IDE, page designer, responsive universal theme and theme roller 
5.1 - IG 
18.1 - new create application wizard(blue print) ,ew creat page(dashboard page, side by side master detail page), apex spot light search, new rest workshop, rest enabled sql 
192 - faceted search, enahnced list of value, enahnced pop list of values, rest enabled IG, UT improvements(dark mode, collapsible menu, new login page style)
20.1 - Friendly URLs, better version Software control, Faceted Search, Mega Menus, Redwood User Interface (UI), PDF printing


What are skills required for APEX Developers?
SQL, PL/SQL are essential. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are good to have skills to understand and customize look and feel (themes, templates, …. ).

What are the different type of apex users 
Users are divided into three primary roles developer, Workspace administrators  and Instance administrators

Some views of apex
apex_workspaces,apex_workspace_activitiy_log etc

How will you validate apex
Utlrp.sql  or
SQL> exec validate_apex; (If your APEX version is 2.0 or above)

How will you direct your application to use https instead of http?


How is APEX a RAD Tool?
You can prototype screens while sitting with the user. The Object Browser allows you to create database objects such as tables in addition to viewing those same objects. Quick SQL allows you to create objects on the fly and then build tables around those objects. Al you need is a browser and all applications are run within a browser. Turn-around time is immediate. 

Because APEX is declarative, you can easily make changes in real-time via the built-in wizards. 

By default APEX manages : 
session information for you, 
use the security framework built into the Oracle Database,
manages connection to database 
manages your authentication and authorisation
you can concentration delivering applications, not on connection configuration and other typical web development time wasters.

How much does APEX Cost and where can I get it?
Oracle Application Express comes as a free add-on with all edition of Oracle database (enterprise, standard). If you chose to “try before you buy”, or since it’s free, “try before you install”, you can also use the hosted APEX Online facility. or install it on top of Oracle XE database.
This facility allows you to create and run complete applications just as you would on your own equipment.

What is the current version of APEX and why should I upgrade?
current version is 20.1 and 20.2 is in progress. apex.oracle.com is now in 20.2


 What is the future of Application Express?
Oracle has made a large commitment to Application Express. APEX is the glue that can combine various parts of an enterprise solution into a whole. APEX is the tool of choice to create web-based, database-centric applications. If your business logic is in the database tier, APEX is the way to go.

Are there any limitations in using Oracle XE?
XE 18 is the recent version database which is free but Oracle has built certain limitations into the product.
The first limitation is memory. Oracle Database XE can address only 2GB of RAM. This limitation mainly affects how many users can access the database concurrently and how well it performs.
The second limit is that XE will only use one core CPU. XE will run on a multi -CPU computer but wont scale up to use those CPUs. This functionality requires Oracle Database Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition.
The third limit is that only a single XE database can run on any given computer. You do not need a database for each application. Instead, Oracle uses the concept of schemas to separate applications.
Finally, a 12 GB limit is enforced on disk space.12 GB is a huge amount of storage for most applications. You can also use APEX to link to other databases (on other servers) for more storage as needed.

How do I backup and restore an Oracle XE Database?

How to make applications portable?
To ensure application can easily be moved from one Application Express environment to another you should avoid hard coded references to values that may change between environments.
For example, the application ID is often referenced in URLs throughout an application. The Application Express engine uses the application ID to uniquely identify the application fetched and run from the application repository. Rather than using the actual application ID as is done in the URL below:
f?p=100:1:&APP_SESSION.:
It is recommended to use an indirect reference instead:
f?p=&APP_ID.:1:&APP_SESSION.:
Here, &APP_ID. is a built in substitution string that replaces the hard coded value 100. Using this technique, no modifications have to be made prior to deployment, even if the application ID changes.
Similarly, to ensure smooth deployment, references to images in templates, HTML regions or SQL queries should use substitution strings instead of hard coded paths.
Consider, for example, an application whose images are stored on the file system in the virtual path /dev/images/ in a development environment and /prod/images/ on the production server.
Use substitution strings at the application level to avoid having to make changes throughout the application before deployment. E.g., define substitution string IMAGE_PATH, and give it a value of /dev/images/

Should static files be placed in the database?
Application Express applications may reference additional external files such as cascading style sheets (CSS), images and Javascript libraries.
These images can either be placed on the file system of the server that runs the web server or, when they are uploaded using Application Express’s application builder, can be stored inside the database.
A benefit of managing files such as images and CSS in the database with the application builder is that they can be exported and imported into another Application Express environment or workspace using only a browser.
However, storing related files in the database is recommended only when you have relatively few images and when the application is not expected to endure high request throughput.
When images, CSS and Javascript libraries are stored in the database, a database connection is established each time the browser requests one of these files.
In a high throughput application this may result in undue and unwanted strain on the database.

How do I separate development from production environment?
Depending on requirements for the availability of the application, the size of the user population and other factors you can decide how to divide the development environment from the production environment.
For certain applications, it is acceptable to combine the development server with the deployment server, as long as the end users understand that sometimes the application is not available.
Other applications may require two (development and production) or even three (development, test and production) servers.
In Application Express applications can be moved from environment to environment using an export and import facility for application definitions.
With one server available to run the database and Application Express, you can still separate the development version of an application from its production version by using two workspaces accessing separate schemas.
In this case one workspace will be used by developers and the other will be the workspace in which the application is deployed in production. We will add few more Oracle Apex Interview Questions soon.



What kind of applications you have created?
1. Last project we made web app for managing the clearing process.
Clearing is the process which gives last chance to students to get their place secured in an uni. 
The overall process is universities still have some vacant places they want to fill and some students who have not got a confirmed place in any university. Every year UK govering body UCAS declares dates for clearing. 

Before that the university departments need to setup the courses partcipating in clearing and the number of vacancies in the course
They also need to setup which are the list of qualifications, subjects and grades acceptable a specific course and they also need to set up a tariff for such qualification/subject and grade. let's say A level physics grade A* is 96 points. And also they need to announce total tariff required for offering a place. minimu cut off without which cnddidates can be outrightly rejected. And all other students be referred in case they still have some empty places to fill. 
Setting up all these meta data and reviewing that is done using internal app. 
reports and manually offering applicants.
taking phone calls and revewing application adding notes


internal facing app for setting up courses which are available for clearing


public facing app for collecting student details( e.g their personal details like name, email telephone, qualification detais, qualification, subject, year, grade), Collecting qualification was a bit tricky because there is no standard set of attributes some internation qualification like IELTS, TOFEL, and IB has completely different set of attributes, like read, write, listen, spoken grades and there is no subject to choose.
then finally app running the validation process to see if applicant is eligible for offer/reject or review 
accordingly shows the message on screen and sends notificatiob email and text message.

department staff can review applications of their own course and take action against them 
department users have roles as admin, editor, reader
authenticated by coprorate active directory
creating application users 
self service registration

When to go for APEX and When not to go for APEX?

if web application is based on data in oracle database then most requiremnts can be implemented easily
Name few Oracle APEX applications you know - best examples are ask tom, apex.oracle.com, live sql, covid 19 uk

Explain the URL structure of an application.

How will you debug an application? (Debug flag)

How will you define page cache?
Enabling region caching is an effective way to improve the performance of static regions such as regions containing lists that do not use conditions or regions containing static HTML.When you enable region caching, the Application Express engine renders a region from a cached (or stored) repository instead of rendering it dynamically. 
Server Cache = Disabled, Enabled, Enabled, Cache by Session

Specifying a static region ID is useful when creating custom JavaScript or cascading style sheets. 

Where will you add Java Script coding?

if you create an item with the name P1_FIRST_NAME and a label of First Name, the ID is P1_FIRST_NAME. You can get and set item attributes and values using the JavaScript functions $v('P1_FIRST_NAME') and $s('P1_FIRST_NAME', 'Joe');

function showFirstName(){
 alert('First Name is ' +$v('P1_FIRST_NAME'))
};
function setFirstName(pFirstName){
 $s('P1_FIRST_NAME', pFirstName);
};

Incorporating JavaScript Functions

There are two primary places to include JavaScript functions:
    In the HTML Header attribute of the page
    In a .js file in the page template

https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/application-express/19.1/aexjs/index.html

APEX provides a number of specific places for you to add JavaScript code. 
You should avoid entering your own <script> tags in places where markup is allowed. 
Also avoid entering JavaScript code using the javascript: pseudo-protocol in places where URLs are allowed.
Various components may have specific attributes for JavaScript code snippets. For example some regions and items have an Advanced: JavaScript Initialization Code attribute that is used for advanced configuration of the region or item. 
Dynamic Actions added to the Global Page can apply to all pages subject to any Server-Side Condition.

Each page can have its own specific JavaScript code added to it using the following page attributes in the "JavaScript" section:
    File URLs - Specify one JavaScript file URL per line. These files could be third party libraries or your own JavaScript code.
    Function and Global Variable Declaration - This code runs after the core APEX libraries and above File URLs have been loaded and before the document is ready (DOMContentLoaded event or jQuery ready).
    Execute when Page Loads - This code runs after the document is ready and after all APEX generated JavaScript code.

If you have a file that you want loaded on all pages you can enter that file in one place rather than on each page. Shared Components > User Interface Attributes > User Interface Details has an attribute where you can enter any number of JavaScript File URLs (one per line).

It is recommended to use Universal Theme. However if you do create your own theme (very few people do this) there is an attribute to specify the JavaScript File URLs that are needed by your theme.

How will you access page items in Javascript?

alert('First Name is ' + document.getElementById('P1_FIRST_NAME').value );
value = apex.item( "P1_ITEM" ).getValue();

What is the use of Page Group? Or what is Page Group feature? How will you create a page group?
Page groups do not have any function other than to help developers organize their application pages.
utilities > page group from right hand side 

What is ‘page zero‘? How can you restrict page zero items across application?

Page zero of your application functions as a master page. The Application Express engine renders all components you add to page zero on every page within your application. You can further control whether the Application Express engine renders a component or runs a computation, validation, or process by defining conditions.

Page zero is now called as global page in recent releases.

How a page is rendered? (Show page and Accept page process)?

To view a rendered version of your application,you request it from the Application Express engine with a URL. When you run anapplication, the Application Express engine relies on two processes:

•Show Page - When you request a page using a URL, the engine is running Show Page. Show Page is a page rendering process that assembles all the page attributes (including regions, items, and buttons) into a viewable HTML page.

•Accept Page - Accept Page performs forms page processing, including computations, validations, processes, and branching. When you submit a page,the Application Express engine is running Accept Page or performing pageprocessing during which it saves the submitted values in the session cache andthen performs any computations, validations, or processes.

Oracle Application Express issues implicit commits at the following points:
•On load, after a page finishes rendering
•On submit, before branching to another page•On submit, if one or more validations fail, before re-rendering the page
•After a computation
•After changing the value of an item, for example after a PL/SQL processthat modifies a bind variable value or when APEX_UTIL.SET_SESSION_STATE is called.
•When APEX_MAIL.PUSH_QUEUE is called

Themes

    Can you define custom theme?
    Yes, we can create a custom theme. Theme is basically collection of templates and usually we make a copy of universal theme and then copy of existing templates and then start modifying this.
    A Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) provides a way to control the style of a web page without changing its structure.
    quick edit provides a live template options, that is also a nice way of creating themes and templates.
    CSS
    color:#ff1744; font-style:italic; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;
    <span style="#NAME_STYLE#">#NAME#</span>

    What are the other ways of authorization?
    Where can you apply authorization? Custom defined authorization?
    Authorization is a broad term for controlling access to resources based on user privileges
    Common authorization scheme types include Exists, Not Exists SQL Queries, and PL/SQL Function Returning Boolean.

Authentication

    What are the authentication methods available?
    Application Express Accounts, Custom Authentication, Database Accounts, HTTP Header Variable, LDAP Directory, Open Door Credentials, Social Sign-In
    
    How will you create a custom authentication?
    for custom auth create a function returning boolean and taking two arguments p_username and p_password
    DBMS_LDAP.init, DBMS_LDAP.simple_bind_s


Interview Questions on Security

    What are the security options available for APEX applications?
    Implement SSL, define association between schema and workspace, Restricting User Access by IP Address(comma delimited IP list), configure appropriate session timeout, enable minimum password strength, restrict password reuse,max password life time. When sensitive data must persist in a session, it should be saved in Oracle Application Express session state tables in encrypted form. To use this feature, set the page item's Store value encrypted in session state attribute to On. Encrypted stored values are automatically decrypted when read.
    shared components > Session State Protection status (Enabled or Disabled) then we need to specify "Page Access Protection" and "Application Item Protection" and "Page Item Protection" values can be 
    Unrestricted - Arguments Must Have Checksum - If Request, Clear Cache, or Name/Value arguments appear in the URL, a checksum must also be provided. 
    Arguments Must Have Checksum - If Request, Clear Cache, or Name/Value arguments appear in the URL, a checksum must also be provided.
    No Arguments Allowed - A URL may be used to request the page but no Request, Clear Cache, or Name/Value arguments are allowed.
    No URL Access - The page may not be accessed using a URL; however, the page may be the target of a Branch to Page branch type, which does not do a URL redirect.
    Application Item Protection : 
    Unrestricted - The item's session state may be set by passing the item name/value in a URL or in a form. No checksum is required in the URL.
    Checksum Required: Application Level - The item's session state may be set by passing the item name/value in a URL if a checksum specific to the schema is provided. You can also use a user-level checksum or a session-level checksum (see next bullets). Use this option when you want to allow the item to be set only by URLs having checksums that were generated by any user running the same application in the current workspace but in a different session.

    Checksum Required: User Level - The item's session state may be set by passing the item name/value in a URL if a checksum specific to the workspace, application, and user is provided. You can also use a session-level checksum (see next bullet). Use this option when you want to allow the item to be set only by URLs having checksums that were generated by the same named user, running the same application in the current workspace but in a different session.

    Checksum Required: Session Level - The item's session state may be set by passing the item name/value in a URL if a checksum specific to the current session is also provided. Use this option when you want to allow this item to be set only by URLs having checksums that were generated in the current session.

    Restricted - May not be set from browser - The item may not be altered using the URL or POSTDATA. Use this option when you want to restrict the way that the item value can be set to internal processes, computations, and so on. This attribute is applicable only to items that cannot be used as data entry items and is always observed even if Session State Protection is disabled.
    
    SSP can be set at application level, page level and item level 

    How will you disable SQL injections?
    substitution variable syntax &. is useful when displaying text dynamically in html but dangreous when used in sql. bind variable syntax should be used instead While building dynamic queries use bind variable instead of concate operation. Use CREATE_COLLECTION_FROM_QUERY_B CREATE_COLLECTION_FROM_QUERY_B2 instead of CREATE_COLLECTION_FROM_QUERY as former use bind variable syntax. Use HTF.ESCAPE_SC and APEX_JAVASCRIPT.ESCAPE for displaying any report where fields are inputed by any form by end user to avoid XSS problem. The HTP.PS function should be used to escape any data from the database. This will automatically escape the <,>,”,& characters.
    begin
    sys.htp.p(apex_escape.html_whitelist('<h1>Hello<script>alert("XSS");</script></h1>')); 
    end;
    https://explorer.co.uk/securing-vulnerability-exploits-apex-part-3/
    How will you use check sums? APEX_ITEM.MD5_CHECKSUM. Check sums in URLs.
    How will you ensure strong password? APEX_UTIL.STRONG_PASSWORD_VALIDATION
    How will you find how many users clicked a HREF? APEX_UTIL.COUNT_CLICK. APEX_WORKSPACE_CLICKS View has the report.

Interview Questions on Sessions
    f?p=App:Page:Session:Request:Debug:ClearCache:itemNames:itemValues:PrinterFriendly
    •  Short substitution string: &SESSION.
    •  PL/SQL: V('SESSION')
    •  Bind variable: :APP_SESSION
    Same pattern for &REQUEST. and &DEBUG.
    To reference columns in other reports using substitution variables: column name in upper case and enclosed within two hash #COLUMN_NAME#

    You can escape special characters in the substitution value by appending an exclamation mark (!) followed by a predefined filter name to a page or application item name, report column, or other substitution string. Output escaping is an important security technique to avoid Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in the browser.  Item: &P1_DEPTNO!HTML.  Interactive grid column: &ENAME!HTML., Columns in other reports: #ENAME!HTML#

    ATTR escapes reserved characters in a HTML attribute context, for example:  Interactive grid column: &ENAME!ATTR. Columns in other reports: #ENAME!ATTR#

    JS escapes reserved characters in a JavaScript context, for example:  Item: &P1_DEPTNO!JS. Interactive grid column: &ENAME!JS. Columns in other reports: #ENAME!JS#
    STRIPHTML removes HTML tags from the output and escapes reserved HTML characters, for example: Item: &P1_DEPTNO!STRIPHTML.
: 
    Built-in Substitution Strings : APP_PAGE_ID, APP_REGION_ID, APP_SESSION, APP_UNIQUE_PAGE_ID, APP_USER, HOME_LINK, LOGIN_URL, LOGOUT_URL, REQUEST, SYSDATE_YYYYMMDD, WORKSPACE_ID


    SYS_CONTEXT variable  SYS_CONTEXT('APEX$SESSION', 'APP_SESSION') : also context available for session along with other forms(bind, plsql and substitution string)
     SYS_CONTEXT('APEX$SESSION', 'APP_USER')


APP_UNIQUE_PAGE_ID is an integer generated from an Oracle sequence which is unique for each page view. This number is used by applications to prevent duplicate page submissions and can be used for other purposes. For example, to make a unique URL and avoid browser caching issues, you can embed this number in the request or debug column in calls to the f procedure.

Each application button sets the value of REQUEST to the name of the button or to the request value attribute associated with the button, enabling accept processing to reference the name of the button when a user clicks it. In the f?p syntax, REQUEST may be set using the fourth argument. When you post a page, you initiate Accept processing. Accept processing consists of computations, validations, processes, and branches. The value of REQUEST is available during each phase of the Accept processing. Once an application branches to a sdifferent page then REQUEST is set to NULL.




    To clear cached items on a single page, specify the numeric page number. 
    To clear cached items on multiple pages, use a comma-separated list of page numbers. 
    Clearing a page's cache also resets any stateful processes on the page. Individual or comma-separated values can also include collection names to be reset or the keyword RP, which resets region pagination on the requested page. 
    The keyword APP clears cache for all pages and all application-level items in the current
    application and removes sort preferences for the current user. The keyword SESSION achieves the same result as the APP keyword, but
    clears items associated with all applications that have been used in the current session.

    to set item value use Comma-delimited list of item names and item values separated by colon.  To pass a comma in an item value, enclose the characters with backslashes. For example \123,45\

     Syntax for Referencing Item Values: in SQL as :MY_ITEM, in plsql as V('MY_ITEM') or NV('MY_NUMERIC_ITEM') depending on string or numeric, from static text as &MY_ITEM.

    About Controlling How Items Write Session State

    Per Request (Memory Only) - Do not save state in the database. State is only available when processing the current request. When AJAX requests need to use an item, make sure to pass the item name using the Page Items To Submit attribute.
    Per Session (Disk) - Maintain for each session by storing the value in the database, to access it across requests. 
    Per User (Disk) - Value is saved in a user attribute repository and it is also available for later APEX sessions.

    The following example resets the value of the items THE_EMPNO and THE_DEPTNO:
    f?p=100:5:&APP_SESSION.::NO:THE_EMPNO,THE_DEPTNO

    f?p=6000:6004:&APP_SESSION.::NO:6003:MY_ITEM1,MY_ITEM2,MY_ITEM3:1234,,5678
    •  Runs page 6004 of application 6000 and uses the current session ID
    •  Clears the current session's cache for items on page 6003
    •  Indicates to not show debug information (NO)
    •  Sets the value of MY_ITEM1 to 1234, sets the value of MY_ITEM2 to null (indicated by the comma used as placeholder), and sets the value of MY_ITEM3 to 5678
    
    About Clearing Report Regions
    RR - Resets interactive report, interacitve grids, or classic report and also resets report pagination. If the target page contains interactive report or interacvie grids, the report is returned to the default report settings specified by the developer or saved by the user.  If the target page contains classic report, the report sorting resets to developer defined sorting.
    CR - This applies only to interactive report. CR clears interactive report and resets report pagination. This clears all of the session report settings such as control break, aggregate, flashback, chart, number of rows to display, filter, highlight, computation, group by, and pivot.
    RP - Resets interactive report or classic report pagination.

    How will you configure objects that are dependent on environment?
    How will you enable end users customization (Customization for regions)?
    How will you deploy application? (as SQL files)
    Import / Export options.
    How will you disable developer toolbar?

    Use build options to conditionally include or exclude application components and functionality. 
    Build options enable developers to enable or disable application components and functionality when the application installs or at runtime using the APEX_UTIL.GET_BUILD_OPTION_STATUS and APEX_UTIL.SET_BUILD_OPTION_STATUS APIs.
    You can apply build options to most application components (such as pages, regions, items, validations, and so on) and specify whether to include or exclude them in the runtime application.
    Build options have two possible values:
    •  Include - Application components are enabled and included with the application.
    •  Exclude - Application components are disabled and excluded from the application.

    Use Case 1: Enable and Disable Functionality Based on Installation Type
    Use Case 2: Hiding Incomplete Functionality in Various Environments
    Use Case 3: Determining the Consequences of Removing Functionality

    Creating Build Options > Shared Components > Build Options > Create : 
    Identifies the application to which this build option applies.
    Enter a descriptive name for this build option.
    Status - Options: Include or Exclude
    Default on Export - choose expected behaviour of this build option during export ( e.g same as current status, include or exclude)

Workspace

    What is workspace?
    A workspace is a virtual private database allowing multiple group of users to work within the same Oracle Application Express installation while keeping their objects, data and applications private. Each workspace has a unique numeric ID and name.

    Can more than one schema associated with workspace?
    How will you create a workspace, and what happens in database when you a create a new workspace?
    Oracle Application Express users? Their user roles.
    Developers, Workspace administrators, End users, Oracle Application Express administrators
    APEX_WORKSPACE_APEX_USERS, APEX_APPLICATION_ITEMS, APEX_APPLICATIONS

Admin

    How will you login into APEX admin module? (Internal workspace)

    Differentiate Application Admin and Workspace Admin.
    Workspace Admin : can admin task specific to a workspace such as managing user accounts, altering passwords of users, viewing workspace activity managing, development services.
    Instance Admin : superusers that manage the entire hosted instance using the Oracle Application Express Administration Services application. This role is not available in oracle cloud

    Who are the users and their privileges? developer, workspace admin, end user
    Name few important APEX functions? (APEX_UTIL, APEX_EXEC, APEX_WEBSERVICE, APEX_ZIP, APEX_SESSION, APEX_ITEM)

        apex_collection.create_collection(p_collection_name => 'EMPLOYEES')
        apex_collection.collection_exists (p_collection_name => 'EMPLOYEES')
        SELECT c001, c002, c003, n001, d001, clob001
        FROM APEX_collections
        WHERE collection_name = 'EMPLOYEES'
    begin
        apex_ir.add_filter(
        p_page_id => 1,
        p_region_id => 2505704029884282,
        p_report_column =>'DEPTNO',
        p_filter_value =>'30',
        p_operator_abbr =>'EQ',
        p_report_id =>880629800374638220);
    end;
    APEX_IR.RESET_REPORT

    APEX_ITEM : You can use the APEX_ITEM package to create form elements dynamically based on a SQL query instead of creating individual items page by page.

        begin
            apex_session.attach (
                p_app_id => 100,
                p_page_id => 1,
                p_session_id => 12345678 );
            sys.dbms_output.put_line ('App is '||v('APP_ID')||', session is '||v('APP_SESSION'));
        end;

        apex_session.create_session (
            p_app_id => 100,
            p_page_id => 1,
            p_username => 'EXAMPLE USER' );

        begin
        apex_session.detach;
        end;

        apex_session.set_debug (
        p_session_id => 1234,
        p_level => apex_debug.c_log_level_info ); -- p_level = null disables debug
        commit;

        apex_session.set_trace (
            p_session_id => 1234,
            p_mode => 'SQL' );
            commit;

        The following example demonstrates how to get the query context for a given saved interactive report on page 1 and print the data out as JSON.
        declare
            l_context apex_exec.t_context;
        begin
            l_context := apex_region.open_query_context (
            p_page_id => 1,
            p_region_id => 2505704029884282,
            p_component_id => 880629800374638220 );
            apex_json.open_object;
            apex_json.write_context( 'data', l_context );
            apex_json.close_object;
        end;

        apex_string.format('%s+%s=%s', 1, 2, 'three')
        apex_string.format('%1+%2=%0', 'three', 1, 2)
        apex_string.get_initials('Saroj Raut') -- SR
        apex_string.join_clob(apex_t_varchar2(1,2,3),':') --1:2:3
        apex_string.join(apex_t_number(1,2,3),':') --1:2:3
        apex_string.split('1:2:3',':') --apex_t_varchar2('1','2','3')
        apex_string.split('key1=val1, key2=val2','\s*[=,]\s*') -- apex_t_varchar2('key1','val1','key2','val2')
        declare
            l_table apex_t_varchar2 := apex_string.split('1234567890',null);
        begin
            dbms_output.put_line(apex_string.join(apex_string.shuffle(l_table),':'));
        end; -- a permutation of 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:0

        APEX_UTIL.GET_SESSION_STATE('my_item'); -- short hand is v function
        apex_util.get_since(last_updated_on) last_update
        APEX_UTIL.SET_SESSION_STATE('my_item','myvalue');

Different Oracle Application Express Environments
When you install Oracle Application Express, you can install two different environments: full development environment  or  runtime environment


Metadata

    How is APEX Application components stored inside DB?
    What is Oracle Application Express Engine? (session state management, auth & authori, page flow, validations processing, page rendering and processing)
    How will you find the logged in user? APP_USER.


-- Submitting disabled items to session state
Disabled items are not submitted to page session in apex and sometimes you may need to disable some items to stop end users from changing the value but want to submit the value to session state
-- Create a dynamic action on event before page submit and execute java script = $(':disabled').removeAttr('disabled');
