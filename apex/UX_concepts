UX 
 Humans are individuals, users have different needs, hard to measure if it's fine or not.
Constraints : Time, budget, APEX, design skills etc
we don't have infinite time or budget to think about UX
APEX is a framework, it has it's own designs and we can't change everything in a way we want. For example regions looks how it looks.
Sometimes it's difficult though not impossible. The question then is it really worth putting that effort to change and manage by ourself

Understand your audience
Age range, cultural background, education level
small vs large screen
multi monitors
touch screen
Usage context : how much time do users spend with the app. how critical is the impact if we don't make that change
UX really depends on the purpose of the app
clean professional vs playful and engaging
There is no golden standard for UX
Typical data driven apps for company employees
App Structure: why structure is important
users don't like to get lost
users like to easily find things
users don't like to get overwhelmed by too many options
users value predictable navigation pattern (If they go to separate section they can apply the common patterns)
users appreciate logical grouping of related features
Not every page need to be accessible from main menu
group those in logical sections
level of details hidden by default
imagine settings menu on your phone, there are certain least used tings that needs few clicks to get there

When are you teaching him the trend of requesting is fine

Style and Color
content matters
this is not about taste
people come to the app because they get paid to use the app to get their task done 
they come to the app because they have to use it not because they are liking the app
we can make the app appealing but it's not an art contest what matters the most is the content
Imagine a art gallery, if you remove the arts the gallery becomes boring.
We need to present the content, e.g. look at youtube all white, just about content and the rhumb nails
Wikipedia .. so boring look
we are going there because of their content not fancy animation or cool design
same as google
it's not preference it's timeless
making buttons colourful is bad design, they are already distingushible by name and action, extra colours wanting unnecessary attention
highlight primary action: guiding you to do something, there should never be two primary actions
If you think there are two primary buttons, then probably there is no primary button for highliting purpose

color has meaning
blue - highlight
green- success, something worked
yello-warning, caution
red - bad, denger, destructive

if you don't use these properly then you loose the meaning of colour and people tends to devalue that
hot buttons should not be red or yellow. even if your company branding has that color, as it clashes with semantic meaning
you don't have to give up your corporate identity as on argument

Data display
Tables: structures and analytical data display, IR sort,filter, highlight, saved report, mostly for big screens
when everything in an interface is competing for attention, it feels noisy and chaotic
Like one big wall of content where it's not clear what really matters
Visual hierarchy, making something feel designed

custom views
easy to scan
responsive for small screen
most importantly it gives the visual hierarchy(most important to least important)
if we sell products then adding custom template makes sense. for internal use consider cerefully

Chart
this is a complicated area
it depends on what question the chart is expected to answer
read the issue with pie chart: guessing size from angle is diff, bar gives a good sense quickly

Offer predictable value
floating labels are designed for small screen. If most users are big screen
Only use an icon if their meaning is obvious
omit icon if they don't add value
check: would you get what an action does only with the icon without the label

Uncertainty causes fear
You know the app as I have built it
User's don't know what's behind UI
Add confirmation dialog for destructive actions
give consistent and good naming Use language everybody understand
Don't overwhelm users
subpages if one page gets too big
different pages for different action
don't show too many buttons, hide actions behind menu
Rarely used info in a collapsible region/tabs

Don't frustrate users
huge form? let user copy entries or save drafts
validate early
give clear error messages
keep pages fast
move long running tasks to background(notify when done)

Be in contact with your users
watch how they use the app
let them give you feedback
consider evaluating usage metrics

On key takeaway : simple boring UIs that serve the content not overwhelm the users
