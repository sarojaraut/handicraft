Available storage classes

Standard Storage	STANDARD	None	 >99.99% in multi-regions and dual-regions, 99.99% in regions

Nearline Storage	NEARLINE	30 days	 99.95% in multi-regions and dual-regions, 99.9% in regions

Coldline Storage	COLDLINE	90 days	 99.95% in multi-regions and dual-regions, 99.9% in regions

Archive Storage 	ARCHIVE	    365 days 99.95% in multi-regions and dual-regions, 99.9% in regions

Standard Storage is best for data that is frequently accessed ("hot" data) and/or stored for only brief periods of time.

Nearline Storage is a better choice than Standard Storage in scenarios where slightly lower availability, a 30-day minimum storage duration, and costs for data access are acceptable trade-offs for lowered at-rest storage costs.

Nearline Storage is ideal for data you plan to read or modify on average once per month or less. For example, if you want to continuously add files to Cloud Storage and plan to access those files once a month for analysis, Nearline Storage is a great choice.

Nearline Storage is also appropriate for data backup, long-tail multimedia content, and data archiving. Note, however, that for data accessed less frequently than once a quarter, Coldline Storage or Archive Storage are more cost-effective

Coldline Storage is a very-low-cost, highly durable storage service for storing infrequently accessed data. Coldline Storage is a better choice than Standard Storage or Nearline Storage in scenarios where slightly lower availability, a 90-day minimum storage duration, and higher costs for data access are acceptable trade-offs for lowered at-rest storage costs.

Archive Storage is the lowest-cost, highly durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery. Unlike the "coldest" storage services offered by other Cloud providers, your data is available within milliseconds, not hours or days.

Key terms

Projects
All data in Cloud Storage belongs inside a project. A project consists of a set of users, a set of APIs, and billing, authentication, and monitoring settings for those APIs. You can have one project or multiple projects.

Buckets
Buckets are the basic containers that hold your data. Everything that you store in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. You can use buckets to organize your data and control access to your data, but unlike directories and folders, you cannot nest buckets.
To Create a new bucket you need to choose:
a globally-unique name, because every bucket resides in a single Cloud Storage namespace
a geographic location 
a default storage class
you can change its default storage class after creation but you can't change name and location

There is a per-project rate limit to bucket creation and deletion of approximately 1 request every 2 seconds, so plan on fewer buckets and more objects in most cases. 
Highly available applications should not depend on bucket creation or deletion in the critical path of their application, due to rate limit and centralised namespace. better  pre-create all the buckets necessary.

Your bucket names must meet the following requirements:

Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters(no uppercase), numbers, dashes (-), underscores (_), and dots (.). Spaces are not allowed. Names containing dots require verification.
Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
Bucket names must contain 3-63 characters. Names containing dots can contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be no longer than 63 characters.
Bucket names cannot be represented as an IP address in dotted-decimal notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
Bucket names cannot contain "google" or close misspellings, such as "g00gle".

Objects
Objects are the individual pieces of data that you store in Cloud Storage. There is no limit on the number of objects that you can create in a bucket.

Objects have two components: object data and object metadata.

Geo-redundancy
Data that is geo-redundant is stored redundantly in at least two separate geographic places separated by at least 100 miles. Objects stored in multi-regions and dual-regions are geo-redundant, regardless of their storage class.

Object immutability
Objects are immutable, which means that an uploaded object cannot change throughout its storage lifetime.In practice, this means that you cannot make incremental changes to objects, such as append operations or truncate operations. However, it is possible to replace objects that are stored in Cloud Storage, and doing so happens atomically: until the new upload completes the old version of the object is served to readers, and after the upload completes the new version of the object is served to readers.
