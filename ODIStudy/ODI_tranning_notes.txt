1. source system defination : topology (jdbc connection string and uid/pwd in defination section)
2. source table structure
3. join conditions
4. target system defination
5. target table structure


knowledge modules
scenario : executables of mappings and packages

source -> staging -> dwh -> datamart

Client : odi studio
Server : Server agent 
Repository : master, work(develop, execution)

major change in odi 11g is adition of weblogic for easy integration with fusion middleware and soa products.
odi 12c : flow based approach and big data integration, additional features for middleware integration

mappings have three views at bottom
over view, logical view and physical view 

logical view : attribute, general, target, journalising, constraints, connector points

in logical view >> target : none, control append, incremental update, slowly changing dimension

physical view depicts the best way of implementing the logical view, if more than one sources are from same data source then those are grouped into one unit etc. generally this will be decided by ODI but on complex scenarios this may need to be adjusted

when you click on individual objects in physical view ODI will give more options > general, attributes, integration knowledge module, check knowledge module

reusable mapping with subselect enabled and source included
scenario

create version
compare with old version
package 

sync and async in package 
scenarios can be async not mapping?
you can set one step as first step during run time

packages can be part of another package after creating scenario for child package 
odi also has inbuilt packages e.g. createting a file at end of execution to mark execution is successfull
