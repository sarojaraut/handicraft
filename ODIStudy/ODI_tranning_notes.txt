knowledge modules
scenario : executables of mappings and packages

source -> staging -> dwh -> datamart

Client : odi studio
Server : Server agent 
Repository : master, work(develop, execution)

major change in odi 11g is adition of weblogic for easy integration with fusion middleware and soa products.
odi 12c : flow based approach and big data integration, additional features for middleware integration

mappings have three views at bottom
over view, logical view and physical view 

logical view : attribute, general, target, journalising, constraints, connector points

in logical view >> target : none, control append, incremental update, slowly changing dimension

physical view depicts the best way of implementing the logical view, if more than one sources are from same data source then those are grouped into one unit etc. generally this will be decided by ODI but on complex scenarios this may need to be adjusted

when you click on individual objects in physical view ODI will give more options > general, attributes, integration knowledge module, check knowledge module
