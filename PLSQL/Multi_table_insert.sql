Multi_table_insert

By specifying FIRST, Oracle stops evaluating the WHEN clause when the first condition is met. Alternatively, if ALL is specified, all conditions will be checked for each row. ALL is useful when the same row is stored in
multiple tables.

INSERT FIRST WHEN today_special_offer = 'Y'
THEN INTO special_purchases
ELSE INTO purchases
SELECT * FROM apr_orders;

you can partition yur mviews and create index as well.

To create a materialized view with REFRESH ON COMMIT option, the owner must have the ON COMMIT object privileges on all tables (referenced in the materialized view) outside the schema or have the ON COMMIT system privilege.

EXECUTE DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('MONTHLY_SALES_MV', 'C');

In the following example, the REFRESH procedure is used to refresh two materialized views, MONTHLY_SALES_MV and Q12003_SALES_MV, using atomic_refresh.

EXECUTE DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('MONTHLY_SALES_MV, Q12003_SALES_MV', atomic_refresh=>TRUE);
