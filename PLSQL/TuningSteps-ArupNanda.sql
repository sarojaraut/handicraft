If lots of data has been deleted from table then large amounts of unused space causes full table scan queries to perform poorly. This is because Oracle is scanning every block beneath the high-water mark, regardless of whether the blocks contain data.

Various tools like EXPLAIN PLAN, Using Autotrace, TKPROF, TOP, VMSTAT, MEMSTAT, can give fair amount of indication about what could be the problem. Once you understand where the time is being spent then you can take remedy action.

-------------
First you have to understand that the database itself is never slow or fastï¿½it has a constant speed. The sessions connected to the database, however, slow down when they hit a bump in the road. To resolve a session performance issue, you need to identify the bump and remove it.

In my experience, the vast majority of poorly performing execution plans can be because of two reasons >
1. Optimizer may not have sufficient information to correctly estimate cardinalities (estimated row counts) -> dbms_stats.create_extended_stats(null,'customers', '(cust_state_province,country_id)');
2. Optimiser does understand the data distribution. -> 
 By adding the FOR COLUMNS clause, you can have the database create the new column group as well as collect statistics for it, all in one step, as shown here:
exec dbms_Stats.gather_table_stats(
     ownname=>null,-
     tabname=>'customers',-
     method_opt=>'for all columns size skewonly,-
     for columns (cust_state_province,country_id) size skewonly');
     
exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats(null,'customers',
     method_opt=>'for all columns size skewonly,
     for columns (lower(cust_state_province)) size skewonly');

Monitoring the session in v$session and getting more information about the problem

1. What is the query?
2. What is the execution plan.
3. What is the state of the session during most of the time of execution(idle, processing or waiting)
4. If the session is waiting then how long the session has been waiting(seconds_in_wait is curren wait and wait_time is last wait time, wait_time is in centi second), A very long wait usually indicates some sort of bottleneck. 
5. if it is waiting then retrive more information on the event it is waiting (event column of v$session) "enq: TX - row lock contention" or "db file sequential read" on DML lock identify the object name and row number. if you see event "db file sequential read" then you know that the session is waiting for I/O from the disk to complete. To make the session go faster, you have to reduce that waiting period. There are several ways to reduce the wait one of the simple option is moving the data object to a faster disk or tune the query to do reduce the I/O required. for finding the data object refer the P1 and P2 column which shows the object id and segment id.
If the wait event is "enq: TX - row lock contention" then find out the exact object and row (dbms_rowid.rowid_create) which is locked and by which session.
6. if session is idle then it is not a database problem, may be the application server or ETL server is causing the delay.
7. Is the number of block I/O required is higher compared to the number of rows fetched, then may be rows are chained and rebuilding the table or index might be the solution.
8. OS level CPU/Memory spike is observed during the query running? May be because of rapid switching of logs, 
9. Read consistency is causing the problem?
10. Is the index fragmented because of vast DML poeration? If the value for DEL_LF_ROWS/LF_ROWS is greater than 2, or LF_ROWS is lower than LF_BLKS, or HEIGHT is 4 then the index should be rebuilt.
12. Is the problem is with insert query during vast number of record inserttion, use of APEND hint direct path load, nologging might be the solution?
13. is the problem is during deleting major portion of rows from a table, then truncate and insert from tem table can be the solution? or partitioning to enble fast data purgning using partition drop might be the solution.
14. is it causing a full table scan and should we create a new index, what type of index, normal btree, bitmap, bitmap joined, reverse key, function based. 
15. Should we use a GTT or IOT

Select best Joining mathod

Nested Loops
If you're joining small subsets of data, the nested loop (NL) method is ideal. If you're returning fewer than, say, 10,000 rows, the NL join may be the right join method. If the optimizer is using hash joins or full table scans, force it to use the NL join method by using the following hint:
SELECT /*+ USE_NL (TableA, TableB) */

Hash Join
If the join will produce large subsets of data or a substantial proportion of a table is going to be joined, use the hash join hint if the optimizer indicates it isnt going to use it:
SELECT /* USE_HASH */

Merge Join
If the tables in the join are being joined with an inequality condition (not an equi join), the merge join method is ideal:
SELECT /*+ USE_MERGE (TableA, TableB) */

Although wait events are great for helping with understanding the speed bumps the sessions experience, they do not show another important attribute of sessions: the use of resources such as CPU, I/O, and memory.  TOP command

Redo Spike

Occasionally you may have a performance issue that will not appear as clearly at the OS level as CPU and memory consumption. One such case is redo generation by the database instance, which, in turn, increases both the rapid switching of redo logs and the creation rate and number of archived logs. This may cause an increase in overall I/O on file systems, causing a systemwide performance issue.

Looking at performance issues in old sessions is easy with an Oracle Database feature called Active Session History - V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY , You need to query this view based on user name and time period

Hints

Types of Hints : Hints can be of the following general types:

ï¿½Single-table : Single-table hints are specified on one table or view. INDEX and USE_NL are examples of single-table hints.
ï¿½Multi-table : LEADING is an example of a multi-table hint. Note that USE_NL(table1 table2) is not considered a multi-table hint because it is actually a shortcut for USE_NL(table1) and USE_NL(table2).
ï¿½Query block : Query block hints operate on single query blocks. STAR_TRANSFORMATION and UNNEST are examples of query block hints.
ï¿½Statement : Statement hints apply to the entire SQL statement. ALL_ROWS is an example of a statement hint.

Hints by Category : Optimizer hints are grouped into the following categories:

ï¿½Hints for Optimization Approaches and Goals : ALL_ROWS, FIRST_ROWS(N)
ï¿½Hints for Access Paths : FULL, HASH, INDEX, NO_INDEX, INDEX_FFS, NO_INDEX_FFS, 
ï¿½Hints for Query Transformations : ï¿½NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION, STAR_TRANSFORMATION, NO_STAR_TRANSFORMATION, FACT, NO_FACT, UNNEST
ï¿½Hints for Join Orders : LEADING, ORDERED, 
ï¿½Hints for Join Operations : USE_NL, NO_USE_NL, USE_HASH, NO_USE_HASH, USE_MERGE, NO_USE_MERGE
ï¿½Hints for Parallel Execution : PARALLEL, NO_PARALLEL
ï¿½Additional Hints : APPEND, PUSH_PRED, NO_PUSH_PRED, DRIVING_SITE

The ALL_ROWS hint instructs the optimizer to optimize a statement block with a goal of best throughputï¿½that is, minimum total resource consumption.
The FIRST_ROWS hint instructs Oracle to optimize an individual SQL statement for fast response, choosing the plan that returns the first n rows most efficiently. For integer, specify the number of rows to return. /*+ FIRST_ROWS(10) */
The APPEND hint instructs the optimizer to use direct-path INSERT if your database is running in serial mode.
The CACHE hint instructs the optimizer to place the blocks retrieved for the table at the most recently used end of the LRU list in the buffer cache when a full table scan is performed. This hint is useful for small lookup tables.
The FULL hint instructs the optimizer to perform a full table scan for the specified table.  /*+ FULL(E) */
The INDEX hint instructs the optimizer to use an index scan for the specified table. /*+ INDEX (employees emp_department_ix)*/ /*+ NO_INDEX(employees emp_empid) */
Influencing the Optimizer with Initialization Parameters
The LEADING hint instructs the optimizer to use the specified set of tables as the prefix in the execution plan. This hint is more versatile than the ORDERED hint.
SELECT /*+ LEADING(e j) */ *
FROM employees e, departments d, job_history j
WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
  AND e.hire_date = j.start_date;
If you specify the ORDERED hint, it overrides all LEADING hints.

The MERGE hint lets you merge views in a query. When the MERGE hint is used without an argument, it should be placed in the view query block. When MERGE is used with the view name as an argument, it should be placed in the surrounding query.

SELECT /*+ MERGE(v) */ e1.last_name, e1.salary, v.avg_salary
   FROM employees e1,
   (SELECT department_id, avg(salary) avg_salary 
      FROM employees e2
      GROUP BY department_id) v 
   WHERE e1.department_id = v.department_id AND e1.salary > v.avg_salary;
   
The NO_QUERY_TRANSFORMATION hint instructs the optimizer to skip all query transformations, including but not limited to OR-expansion, view merging, subquery unnesting, star transformation, and materialized view rewrite. For example:

The NO_USE_HASH hint instructs the optimizer to exclude hash joins when joining each specified table to another row source using the specified table as the inner table.  /*+ NO_USE_HASH(e d) */
The NO_USE_NL hint instructs the optimizer to exclude nested loops joins when joining each specified table to another row source using the specified table as the inner table. /*+ NO_USE_NL(l h) */ 
The ORDERED hint instructs Oracle to join tables in the order in which they appear in the FROM clause. Oracle recommends that you use the LEADING hint, which is more versatile than the ORDERED hint.
/*+ FULL(hr_emp) PARALLEL(hr_emp, 5) */
/*+ FULL(hr_emp) PARALLEL(hr_emp, DEFAULT) */ 
-- Specifying DEFAULT or no value signifies that the query coordinator should examine the settings of the initialization parameters to determine the default degree of parallelism.
The STAR_TRANSFORMATION hint instructs the optimizer to use the best plan in which the transformation has been used. /*+ STAR_TRANSFORMATION */


---- Blog POST
SELECT...
FROM    tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4
WHERE
        tab1.id = tab3.id
AND     tab3.id = tab2.id
AND     tab2.id = tab4.id
AND     {filter clauses};
;

How could I force the optimizer to first join TAB1 and TAB3 with a nested loop, then join this result to TAB2 using a hash etc etc. ??

For the general case Iï¿½m not sure if there is always a solution; but for this particular example, Oracle 10g makes it particularly easy to express:

/*+
        leading (tab1, tab3, tab2, tab4)
        use_nl(tab3)
        use_hash(tab2) swap_join_inputs(tab2)
        use_nl(tab4)
*/
 
The leading() hint allows you to specify the join order, and the use_nl(tab3) ensures we get a nested loop from tab1 to tab3. We then have to join to t2 because of the leading() hint, but the  swap_join_inputs() would make tab2 the build (first) table and the intermediate result the probe (second) table in the hash join. Finally we specify a nested loop for the join to tab4. (For 9i, just change the leading() hint to an ordered() hint, in this case, and swap the order of tab2 and tab3 in the from clause))

-----------------
First you have to understand that the database itself is never slow or fastï¿½it has a constant speed. The sessions connected to the database, however, slow down when they hit a bump in the road. To resolve a session performance issue, you need to identify the bump and remove it.

An Oracle Database session is always in one of three states: 

Idle. Not doing anythingï¿½just waiting to be given some work.
Processing. Doing something usefulï¿½running on the CPU.
Waiting. Waiting for something, such as a block to come from disk or a lock to be released.

2832  WAITED KNOWN TIME  SQL*Net message from client
3346  WAITING            enq: TX - row lock contention

You must look at the STATE column first to determine whether the session is waiting or working and then inspect the EVENT column.

After you determine that a session is waiting for something, the next thing you need to find out is how long the session has been waiting. A very long wait usually indicates some sort of bottleneck.

2832  Working     Last waited 2029 secs for SQL*Net message from client
3346  Waiting     So far 743 secs for enq: TX - row lock contention
4208  Waiting     So far 5498 secs for SQL*Net message from client

Note : wait_time column contains in centi second [hundredths of a second].
Note that an idle session does not show IDLE as the STATE column value; it still shows ï¿½Waiting.ï¿½ You have to check the EVENT column to determine whether the session is truly idle. e.g ï¿½SQL*Net message from clientï¿½ and ï¿½rdbms ipc messageï¿½ idle events.

Session 4208 is idle, so any complaints that session 4208 is slow just arenï¿½t related to the database. Any performance issues related to this session could be related to a bug in the code thatï¿½s going through an infinite loop or high CPU consumption on the application server. You can redirect the performance troubleshooting focus toward the application client.

The story of session 3346 is different. This session is truly a bottleneck to the application. Now that you know why this session appears slowï¿½it is waiting for a row lockï¿½the next logical question is which session holds that lock.

select 
  blocking_session B_SID,
  blocking_instance B_Inst
from v$session
where sid = 3346;

B_SID   B_INST
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
 2832      1

The output shows clearly that SID 2832 is holding the lock that SID 3346 is waiting for. Now you can follow a cause/effect relationship between the session in which an update to a row is being blocked and the session that holds the lock on that row.

where object_id = 241876;

Another major cause of contention is disk I/O. When a session retrieves data from the database data files on disk to the buffer cache, it has to wait until the disk sends the data. This wait shows up for that session as ï¿½db file sequential readï¿½ (for index scans) or ï¿½db file scattered readï¿½ (for full-table scans) in the EVENT column, as shown below:
 
select event
from v$session
where sid = 3011;

EVENT
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
db file sequential read

When you see this event, you know that the session is waiting for I/O from the disk to complete. To make the session go faster, you have to reduce that waiting period. There are several ways to reduce the wait

Reduce the number of blocks retrieved by the SQL statement. Examine the SQL statement to see if it is doing a full-table scan when it should be using an index, if it is using a wrong index, or if it can be rewritten to reduce the amount of data it retrieves.
Place the tables used in the SQL statement on a faster part of the disk.
Consider increasing the buffer cache to see if the expanded size will accommodate the additional blocks, therefore reducing the I/O and the wait.
Tune the I/O subsystem to return data faster.

To find the table causing a wait, you will again use the V$SESSION view. The viewï¿½s P1 and P2 columns provide information about the segment the session is waiting for. Listing 7 shows a query of P1 and P2, and the output.

Code Listing 7: Checking data access waits

You can move the table to a high-speed disk for faster I/O, or, alternatively, you can focus on making I/O in this table faster by making changes that affect this table, such as creating new indexes, creating materialized views, or building a result cache.

you can see that session 37 (SID = 37) waited 513,810 ms, or more than 8.5 minutes, for the ï¿½direct path read tempï¿½ event. Every time the session waited for this event, it waited 1.1 ms on average, so if you can reduce the time for this event, you can reduce the overall time for the session. Looking at the session event history enables you to identify the biggest contributors to the delay in the session, whether they are currently affecting the session or have already affected it.

Did you notice the column for the maximum time waited: ï¿½Max Wait (ms)ï¿½? Why is that information useful? You see, the average wait time does not tell the whole story. Consider the ï¿½SQL*Net message from clientï¿½ event in the output in Listing 1. The session waited 20 times with an average wait time of 481 ms for that event. Does that mean that the session waited for approximately 481 ms at each of the 20 occurrences or that the session waited a very short time for most of the event instances and a very long time for one event? The latter will skew the average to a high value but will indicate an isolated issue rather than a persistent oneï¿½the two possibilities lead to very different conclusions.

The ï¿½Max Wait (ms)ï¿½ column shows the maximum time the session had to wait for one occurrence of this event. The value here is 9,619 ms, and because the total wait time was 9,620 ms, it appears that the session waited 9,619 ms on one occasion, leaving a 1 ms combined total for the other 19 occasionsï¿½a very small wait each time. Considering the single incidence of a large wait, this event should not be a general cause of concern. On the other hand, had you seen a maximum time close to the average time, you could surmise that all occurrences had to wait about the same amount of time. In such a case, reducing the time for this event would likely apply uniformly to all occurrences and consequently reduce the overall elapsed time.

Although the V$SESSION_EVENT view shows what the session waited for earlier, it doesnï¿½t show when. That information is visible in another viewï¿½V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY

Although wait events are great for helping with understanding the speed bumps the sessions experience, they do not show another important attribute of sessions: the use of resources such as CPU, I/O, and memory. A resource-hogging session deprives other sessions of the same resources, thus causing performance issues. When the root of the problem is that the session is consuming too much CPU, you should look at resource consumptionï¿½not the events waited forï¿½by a session.

In the output in Listing 2, you can see that the process with ID 5946 consumes the most CPU (100 percent) and memory (10 percent) and therefore should be the focus of your attention. To find out more about the process, enter the following command at the UNIX prompt: 
$ ps -aef|grep 5946

oracle    5946  5945 63 10:59 ? 00:01:52 oracleD112D2 (DESCRIPTION=(LOCAL=YES)(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=beq)))

The output shows the entire description of the process, which is clearly an Oracle ï¿½server processï¿½ï¿½a process that is created by Oracle Database when a session is establishedï¿½and that the process has been running for 1 minute and 52 seconds. The next question, then, is which Oracle Database session this process was created for.

select sid
from v$session s, v$process p
where p.spid = 5946
and s.paddr = p.addr;

SID
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
37

Once you know the SID, you can get everything you need to know about the sessionï¿½the user who established the session, the machine it came from, the operating system user, the SQL it is executing, and so onï¿½from the V$SESSION view.

Then you need to know if the CPU consumption was recent or if the session has been chewing it up since the beginning. This is where the V$SESSTAT view comes in very handyï¿½it shows the resource consumption (CPU in this case) by a specific session. To find out the CPU used by session 37, you would use the following query: 

select s.value
from v$sesstat s, v$statname n
where s.sid = 37
and n.statistic# = s.statistic#
and n.name = 'CPU used by this session';

VALUE
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
47379

The output shows the number of CPU ï¿½ticksï¿½ that have been consumed by this session since it started. Considering that this session has been running for about two minutes, the CPU consumption is pretty high, so it is likely that this session has been consuming CPU all the time. Again, checking the sessionï¿½s other details, such as the SQL it is executing, makes it fairly easy to understand why this is the case

Letï¿½s revisit the current problem by checking the CPU consumption once again with this: 
select s.valuez
from v$sesstat s, v$statname n
where s.sid = 37
and n.statistic# = s.statistic#
and n.name = 'CPU used by this session';

VALUE
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
69724

Now the resultï¿½the CPU usedï¿½is 69,724. Note that this number is larger than the number the last time I checked CPU usage (47,379). This is because the statistic value increases over time.

In the output, note the ï¿½table scan rows gottenï¿½ statistic value: 1.0236E+10 ï¿½about 10 billion rows( 1.0236E+10 = 10,236,000,000)! This is indeed a very high number of rows to be accessed by one session in two minutes.  
The value for the ï¿½consistent getsï¿½ statistic is 25,898,543ï¿½about 25.9 million blocks read from the buffer cache. The high number of buffer gets takes up a considerable amount of CPU.
Also note the ï¿½parse count (total)ï¿½ statistic, a very high number at 143,292. It means that the session had to parseï¿½not just executeï¿½SQL statements that many times in about two minutes, which is quite unusual.
Therefore, you surmise from the output that there are two causes of high CPU usage for this session: a high number of buffer gets and a high number of parses.
Also note two other sets of statistics: ï¿½session pga memory maxï¿½ and ï¿½session uga memory max,ï¿½ which indicate the total memory consumed by the session. The very high numbers explain the high memory consumption by the Oracle server process that you noticed in the output of the operating system top command earlier. If you want to reduce the CPU and memory consumption of the server, you need to make sure the session consumes fewer of these resources, by appropriately modifying the SQL statement it issues.

Redo Spike

Occasionally you may have a performance issue that will not appear as clearly at the OS level as CPU and memory consumption. One such case is redo generation by the database instance, which, in turn, increases both the rapid switching of redo logs and the creation rate and number of archived logs. This may cause an increase in overall I/O on file systems, causing a systemwide performance issue. To alleviate this type of issue, you need to locate the session or sessions that caused the generation of high amounts of redo, but looking at OS metrics will not provide any insights into the offending session. In this case, you need to look at the sessions responsible for most of the load: the sessions generating maximum redo. Again, this information is available quite easily in the same V$SESSTAT view. The following query shows the sessions generating the most redo: 
select sid, value
from v$sesstat s, v$statname n
where n.statistic# = s.statistic#
and n.name = 'redo size'
order by value desc;

 SID     VALUE
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
 13   11982752
 10    3372240
 17     964912
 26     571324

 Itï¿½s clear from the output that SID 13 produced most of the redo, followed by SID 10, and so on.
 
Here are some other useful statistics visible in the V$SESSTAT view: 

physical reads: the number of database blocks retrieved from disk
db block changes: the number of database blocks changed in the session
bytes sent via SQL*Net to client: the bytes received from the client over the network, which is used to determine the data traffic from the client 
These are just a few of the 604 such statistics available in the V$SESSTAT view.

With the other query the optimizer has a lot more information to work with. It knows approximately how many rows will come back, due to the predicate with constant values. So what you are dealing with is a query in which the optimizer will have a really hard time obtaining correct cardinality.

-- On Constraints, Metadata, and Truth : By Tom Kyte

Many people think of constraints as a data integrity thing, and itï¿½s trueï¿½they are. But constraints are used by the optimizer as well when determining the optimal execution plan. The optimizer takes as inputs
 
The query to optimize
All available database object statistics
System statistics, if available (CPU speed, single-block I/O speed, and so onï¿½metrics about the physical hardware)
Initialization parameters
Constraints

People tend to skip constraints in a data warehouse/reporting system. The argument is, ï¿½The data is good; we did a data cleansing; we donï¿½t need data integrity constraints.ï¿½ They might not need constraints for data integrity (and they might be unpleasantly surprised if they did enable them), but they do need integrity constraints in order to achieve the best execution plans. In a data warehouse, a bad query plan might be one that takes hours or days to executeï¿½not just a couple of extra seconds or minutes. It is a data warehouse, therefore, that truly needs constraintsï¿½for performance reasons.

If you have a view containing union of two tables and two tables contains mutually exclusive data(e.g one contains object_type=table and  other objects type=view) and these are defined as constraint. Any query on the view with filter as object_type=table will only access the first table.

if you have a index on not null column and you execute count(*) it will use the index by default(INDEX FAST FULL SCAN). if you donot put the not null constraint it will be a full table scan. (if all columns in an index key are null, no entry will be made in the index), 

select * from t where object_type is null;
That shows that if OBJECT_TYPE is nullable, the optimizer will not (in fact, cannot) use the index to satisfy ï¿½OBJECT_TYPE IS NULL.ï¿½ If we add an attribute to the index that is not null, the plan will change, however. Here Iï¿½ll add the constant zero to the index. (Any not null column will do, and in this case, I just need something not null, and zero is very small and known to be not null.)
create index t_idx on t (object_type, 0);
select * from t where object_type is null;

-- On Clustering Factor and Validating Keys : By Tom Kyte
--

create table t (a number);

insert into t (a)
 with data(r)
 as
 (select 1 r from dual
 union all
 select r+1 from data where r+1 <= 100
 )
 select * from data
 
In short, the index clustering factor is a measure of how many I/Os the database would perform if it were to read every row in that table via the index in index order.
If the rows of a table on disk are sorted in about the same order as the index keys, the database will perform a minimum number of I/Os on the table to read the entire table via the index. That is because the next row needed from an index key would likely be the next row in the table block as well. The query would not be skipping all over the table to find row after rowï¿½they are naturally next to each other on the block. Conversely, if the rows in the table are not in the same order on disk as the index keysï¿½if the data is scatteredï¿½the query will tend to perform the maximum number of I/Os on the table, as many as one I/O for every row in the table. That is because as the database scans through the index, the next row needed will probably not be on the same block as the last row. The database will have to discard that block and get another block from the buffer cache. The query will end up reading every block from the buffer as many times as it has rows on it.

So if a table and an index key are in about the same order, the clustering factor will be near the number of blocks in the table and the index will be useful for very large index range scans and for retrieving numerous rows from the table. On the other hand, if the data is randomly scattered, the clustering factor will be near the number of rows in the table, and given that the number of rows in a table is usually at least an order of magnitude more than the number of blocks, the index will be less efficient for returning numerous rows. 

For example, if a table is 100 blocks in size and has 100 rows per block, an index with a clustering factor of 100 (near the number of blocks) will perform about 2 I/Os against the table to retrieve 200 rows. That is because when the database reads the first table block to get row #1, rows 2ï¿½100 are probably on that same block, so the query will be able to get the first 100 rows by reading the table block once. The process will be similar for rows 101ï¿½200. 

If the index has a clustering factor of 10,000ï¿½the number of rows in the tableï¿½the number of I/Os required against the table will be approximately 200, even though there are only 100 blocks! That is because the first row in the index will be on a different block than the second row, which, in turn, will be on a different block than the third row, and so onï¿½the database will probably never be able to get more than one row from a table block at a time.

Note that when I created these two tables, I used an ORDER BY statement. In the case of the first table, I sorted the data by OBJECT_NAME before loading it into the table. If I were to do a full table scan on the ORGANIZED table, the OBJECT_NAME column would be more or less sorted on the screen even without an ORDER BY (but you need the ORDER BY in the query if you want the data to be sorted). During the creation of the DISORGANIZED table, on the other hand, I sorted by a random valueï¿½I just scrambled the data. If I were to do a full table scan on that table, the OBJECT_NAME values would come out in an arbitrary orderï¿½I might see an object starting with the letter N first, then Z, then A, then Q, then B, then Z again, and so on.

Now Iï¿½ll index and gather statistics on these two tables and look at the statistics, as shown in Listing 1.

As you can see in Listing 1, both tables have the same number of rows and the same number of blocks. That is expectedï¿½they contain exactly the same rows, just in a different order. But when I look at the clustering factor, I see a large difference between the two. The ORGANIZED index has a clustering factor very near the number of blocks in the table, whereas the DISORGANIZED index has a clustering factor near the number of rows in the table. Again, this clustering factor metric is a measure of how many I/Os the database will perform against the table in order to read every row via the index. I can verify this fact by executing a query with tracing enabled that will, in fact, read every row of the table via the index. Iï¿½ll do that by using an index hint to force the optimizer to use my index and count the non-null occurrences of a nullable column that is not in the index. That will force the database to go from index to table for every single row:

  3    from organized;

Reviewing the TKPROF report for reading every row via the index, I discover the results in Listing 2.

 TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID DISORGANIZED (cr=73123 pr=1038 pw=0 t...
  INDEX FULL SCAN DISORGANIZED_IDX (cr=363 pr=0 pw=0 time=47207 us ï¿½

As you can see in Listing 2, I performed 363 I/Os for the ORGANIZED table against the index (cr=363 in the INDEX FULL SCAN ORGANIZED_IDX row source), and if I subtract 363 from the 1,401 total I/Os performed by the query, Iï¿½ll get 1,038, which is exactly the clustering factor of this index. Similarly, if I do the same analysis on the DISORGANIZED index, Iï¿½ll see 73,123 ï¿½ 363 = 72,760 I/Os against the table, again the clustering factor of that index.

So, for one table, the database performs 1,401 total I/Os to retrieve exactly the same data as for the other tableï¿½which needed 73,123 I/Os.

Obviously, one of these indexes is going to be more useful for retrieving a larger number of rows than the other. If I am going to read more than 1,038 blocks of the table via the index, I certainly should be doing a full table scan instead of using an index. I can observe this fact as well, by using autotrace on a few queries against both tables, as shown in Listing 3.

As you can see in Listing 3, both plans expect to return the same number of rows: 149. Both plans are using an index range scan. But the two plans have radically different costs: one has a low cost of 6 and the other a much higher cost of 152ï¿½even though both plans are going after exactly the same set of rows from two tables that contain the same data! The reason for the cost difference is easy to explain: the optimizer computes the cost column value as a function of the number of expected I/Os and the CPU cost. For this simple query, the CPU cost is negligible, so most of the cost is simply the number of I/Os. 

Walking through the first plan, I see there is a cost of 3 for using the index for the ORGANIZED table and indexï¿½about three I/Os against the index, which makes sense. The query will hit the root block, branch, and probably the leaf block. Then the query will be doing about three more I/Os against the table, because the rows needed are all next to each other on a few database blocks, for a total cost of 6. The DISORGANIZED index, on the other hand, does the math a little differently. The plan still has the same three I/Os against the indexï¿½that wonï¿½t changeï¿½but because the rows needed from the table are not next to each other, the optimizer estimates that the query will have to perform an I/O against the table for every row it retrieves, and its estimated cost for 149 rows is 149 rows + 3 I/Os = 152.

If I change the query slightly, I can see what kind of effect this might have on the query plans shown in Listing 4.

 As you can see in Listing 4, the estimated row count has jumped to 1,825 and the ORGANIZED table will still use the index. The cost of the query is 39 ï¿½ 12 I/Os estimated against the index for the range scan and 27 more I/Os against the table. That makes sense, because the ALL_OBJECTS rowsï¿½ size means that about 70 or so fit on a database blockï¿½it would take about 27 blocks to hold 1,825 rows. When I look at the DISORGANIZED table, I see that it gets the same estimated row counts but that the plan is totally different. The optimizer chose not to use an index but instead to do a full table scan. What would the cost of using the index have been? I know from the result in Listing 4 that the cost of the index step (INDEX RANGE SCAN) would be 12, and given that the clustering factor of the index is near the number of rows in the table, I can assume that every row I need to retrieve will require an I/O. So, the query would need to perform 1,825 I/Os against the table, for a total query cost of 1,837ï¿½it would be less expensive to do a full table scan.

In fact, I have enough information to figure out when the optimizer would stop using this index. I know that the cost of a full table scan is 291, and I know that the cost of a query plan that uses an index against this table would be at least equal to the number of estimated rows plus the cost of the query. So if the query is getting around 285 rows, the cost of using the index would probably be around 5 or 6, the cost of the table access would be about 291, and the full table and index scan costs would be tied. Any cost above an estimated row count of 285 would cause the optimizer to do a full table scan. The cost of getting thousands of rows from the organized table is less than the cost of getting a few hundred from the disorganized table. And the clustering factor is what reports that cost, in general, for the index range scan.

Many of you might think the following demonstration is not possible, but it is. Iï¿½ll start with the tables:

 
SQL> create table p
  2  ( x int,
  3    y int,
  4    z int,
  5    constraint p_pk primary key(x,y)
  6  )
  7  /
Table created.

SQL> create table c
  2  ( x int,
  3    y int,
  4    z int,
  5    constraint c_fk_p 
  6    foreign key (x,y) 
  7    references p(x,y)
  8  )
  9  / 
Table created.


 

Looks like a normal parent-child relationship: a row may exist in C if and only if a parent row exists in P. But if that is true, how can this happen?

 
SQL> select count( x||y ) from p;

COUNT(X||Y)
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
          0

SQL> select count( x||y ) from c;

COUNT(X||Y)
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
          1

There are zero records in Pï¿½none. There is at least one record in C, and that record has a non-null foreign key. What is happening?

It has to do with NULLs, foreign keys, and the default MATCH NONE rule for composite foreign keys. If your foreign key allows NULLs and your foreign key is a composite key, you must be careful of the condition in which only some of the foreign key attributes are not null. For example, to achieve the above magic, I inserted
 
SQL> insert into c values ( 1, null, 0 );
1 row created.

The database cannot validate a foreign key when it is partially null. In order to enforce the MATCH FULL rule for composite foreign keys, you would add a constraint to your table:

 
SQL> alter table c add constraint 
check_nullness
  2  check ( ( x is not null 
  3            and y is not null ) or
  4          ( x is null 
  5             and y is null ) ) 
  6  /
Table altered.

The constraint will ensure that either
All of the columns are NULL in the foreign key, or
None of the columns are NULL in the foreign key

As long as that constraint is in place, your foreign key will work as you probably think it should.

This must be the most asked question in discussions involving SQL databases. If there were a 10-step tuning program you could always follow, someone would certainly have automated that processï¿½and called it the optimizer! Tuningï¿½finding the optimal way in which to execute a queryï¿½is what the Oracle Database optimizer is tasked with doing, but often it cannot fully achieve this goal because

It lacks sufficient information because sufficient information does not existï¿½yet. For example, the optimizer may not have sufficient information to correctly estimate cardinalities (estimated row counts), and when that happens, inefficient query plans can happen very readily.
It lacks sufficient information because it does not understand the data. Constraints have been withheld from the optimizer in a misguided attempt to place all logic outside the database.
Its plan is the most efficient possible oneï¿½there is no better planï¿½but there is a problem with the organization of the data.
The query is performing workï¿½retrieving columns and doing computationsï¿½it does not need to do. This frequently happens as the result of using a generic one-size-fits-all view or views of views of views.

In my experience, the vast majority of poorly performing execution plans can be blamed on the first two reasons. This article looks at the first reason in more detail.


In general, when Iï¿½m asked to tune a query, the very first things I want to know are The data model. I want to know everything I can know about the data itself: all tables, indexes, constraints, and assumptions.
The question being asked of the data. Iï¿½ve found more than once that a complex query Iï¿½m asked to look at doesnï¿½t even answer the question being asked. Sometimes, instead of tuning a query, you might want to start from scratch with a self-developed queryï¿½one that specifically answers the question.

Once you have the definitive query you are going to tuneï¿½either the original query or a newly formed oneï¿½you need to understand whether the optimizer has sufficient information to correctly estimate cardinalities. Letï¿½s take a look at this in more detail.

Estimating Cardinalities

If the optimizer incorrectly guesses how many rows will flow out of a step of a plan, the result will likely be a bad query plan. For example, if I gave you the simple query SELECT * FROM T WHERE X=5 and told you that table T has 1 million rows, column X has five distinct values, and column X is indexed, what query plan would you come up with? By default, that is the amount of information the optimizer has to work with in most cases. It knows the number of rows in the table, the number of distinct values in the column, and whether the column is indexed. It knows some other things, tooï¿½the clustering factor of the index, the number of blocks in the table, the average row length, and so onï¿½but those statistics do not help it guess how many rows the query will work with. In this case, the number of rows in the table and the number of distinct values of column X will be the most important facts for developing the query plan.

So again, what query plan would you come up with? The math you would do in your head would probably involve trying to figure out how many rows will be retrieved from table T. That is, youï¿½d try to estimate the cardinality of the WHERE clauseï¿½WHERE X=5. You would likely take the 1,000,000 rows in the table and divide that number by 5 to guess how many rows that WHERE clause will return on average. If there are five distinct values of X and you assume that X is uniformly distributed (because you have to make some assumptions when you donï¿½t have any other information), you would guess that around 200,000 rows would be returnedï¿½20 percent of the table. It is highly likely that you would decide to use a full table scan for that query, as would the optimizer in most cases. But what if, after running the query, you observed that the query returned only 5 rows? It is obvious that you should have instead used the index to get 5 rows, but because you guessed 200,000 rows, you made the wrong choice.

In this clear-cut example, youï¿½and the optimizerï¿½ï¿½got it wrongï¿½ due to insufficient information. The optimizer had no way of knowing that right now X=5 would return only five records. The question then becomes what you can do to tune this query. And the answer is manifold and version-dependent. Typically this list will include the following tuning suggestions:

Supply more statically gathered statistics. A histogram on column X would be appropriate in this case. This approach works in all Oracle Database versions, although the types of statistics you can gather have changed dramatically in Oracle Database 11g with the addition of extended statistics.
Use dynamic sampling. This enables the optimizer to validate its guesses when it needs to (see bit.ly/1qZzy8q). This approach works in Oracle9i Database Release 2 and above.
Generate a SQL profile. A SQL profile enables the optimizer to aggressively look at a query, determine what the real cardinality estimates should be, and then remember this information in the data dictionary. The next time the query is hard-parsed, the optimizer will generate a plan with these adjusted cardinalities. This approach works in Oracle Database 10g and above.

Run the query again! In some cases, starting in Oracle Database 11g, a feature called Cardinality Feedback (bit.ly/X7Dojq) causes the query to be reoptimized during the second execution, using the actual observed valuesï¿½instead of the optimizerï¿½s guessesï¿½as cardinality estimates. In Oracle Database 12c, this facility has been extended via SQL plan directives, making it possible for the optimizer to recognize that it needs additional information and to automatically gather the information the next time statistics are gathered, making the ï¿½fixï¿½ permanent.

Letï¿½s look at this simple case step-by-step. It shows you how to determine whether the optimizer made a miscalculation in the cardinality step, and then, after I gather additional statistics, youï¿½ll see what happens when the optimizer gets a better cardinality estimate.

Iï¿½ll start by building a table with the skewed distribution of the data I am interested in, as shown in Listing 1.

Code Listing 1: Creating table T and skewed data
SQL> create table t
  2  as
  3  select case when mod(rownum,200000) = 0 then 5
  4              else mod(rownum,4)
  5          end X,
  6         rpad( 'x', 100, 'x' ) data
  7    from dual
  8  connect by level <= 1000000
  9  /
Table created.

SQL> create index t_idx on t(x);
Index created.

SQL> exec dbms_stats.gather_table_stats( user, 'T' );
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL> select x, count(*)
  2    from t
  3   group by x
  4   order by x
  5  /

         X   COUNT(*)
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  
         0     249995
         1     250000
         2     250000
         3     250000
         5          5

In this table T, WHERE X=5 will return 5 rows; there is definite skew in this data. I would like to use the index on column X for X=5 but probably not for any other value (0, 1, 2, 3), because queries for those values would return hundreds of thousands of rows. However, when I gather plan statistics and run the queries in Listing 2, I can see that the optimizer made the mistake we all would make, given the information available.

   2 - filter("X"=5)

20 rows selected.



The E-Rows (estimated rows) column shows that the optimizer thought it would get 200,000 rows. The A-Rows (actual rows) column shows that it got only 5. (I got these two columns in my result by using the GATHER_PLAN_STATISTICS hint in the query. This hint doesnï¿½t affect the query plan at all; it affects just the generated code executed at runtime.) The runtime code is instrumented more than usual; it gathered runtime statistics while it was executing. I got this information by using DBMS_XPLAN to display the query plan with the ALLSTATS LAST format. This is a very easy way to quickly see if the optimizer is way off. In this case, I see a huge difference between the actual and estimated rows when the filter X=5 is applied. Using my knowledge of the data (or just running a few queries to learn about the data), I can figure out pretty easily that the optimizer is missing some information.

I fill in the blanks for the optimizer:
SQL> select histogram
  2    from user_tab_columns
  3   where table_name = 'T'
  4     and column_name = 'X';

 Note: I used the NO_INVALIDATE parameter to DBMS_STATS to ensure that the query I am looking at would be hard-parsedï¿½optimizedï¿½on the next execution. By default, DBMS_STATS will not invalidate a cursor immediately but, rather, will invalidate affected cursors slowly over time in the background. You would not typically use NO_INVALIDATE.

Before I gathered table statistics for the second time, there was no histogram on column X. Now, statistics having been gathered, there is a histogram in place. The histogram gives the optimizer much more information about column X in the table. (For more information on histograms and statistics, I recommend the paper at bit.ly/1oQhubY). With the histogram in place, I see a big difference in the optimizer plan and query execution, as shown in Listing 3.

   3 - access("X"=5)

21 rows selected.

The plan is now using an index range scan instead of a full table scan, as you would expect for a small number of rows. Note that the E-Rows column value is not perfect, though. The guess made by the optimizer will rarely, if ever, be 100 percent dead-on, and I would not expect it to be. What is important is that the number is close to being correct. As long as the guess is close enough, the optimizer will choose the right access path, join order, and so on.

One thing you might be wondering about, however, is how just gathering statistics a second time made any difference. And why did the optimizer know to generate histograms the second time but didnï¿½t know this the first time? The answers lie in the fact that the database has been spying on meï¿½watching my predicates and remembering them in the data dictionary. When I ran the query with X=5 in it, the database remembered that, and the next time it gathered statistics, it took the facts that X is used to estimate cardinalities in predicates and that the data values in X are skewed and it automatically generated histograms. This will happen only if you leave the METHOD_OPT parameter in the DBMS_STATS package call at its default value. (For a full example of this feature and information on how it works, see bit.ly/1oQhAQU.)

This was a rather simple example: a single column predicate on a column with skewed data. What about a more complex case? What about a multicolumn predicate? Suppose you have a predicate on a table such as WHERE X = 5 and Y = 10. How do you go about estimating a cardinality for that combination? The optimizer can have a lot of information on X (including histograms) and it can have a lot of information on Y, but it doesnï¿½t know anything by default about X and Y at the same time. In real life, there are often correlations between attributes in a table. Consider a car make and a car color. Do you often see pink Audis? How about lime-green BMWs? Probably not, but you might see a pink or lime-green Volkswagen Beetle. In a table containing information about shoesï¿½along with demographic information such as genderï¿½there is almost certainly a correlation between gender and shoe type. There are too many examples of correlated attributes to list.

So, how can you help the optimizer out here? How can you help it get a better estimated cardinality? Back to my list of tuning suggestions, you could use dynamic sampling (bit.ly/1qZzy8q), SQL profiles, Cardinality Feedback, or static statisticsï¿½known as extended statistics in Oracle Database 11g and above.

Hereï¿½s a demonstration of the static statistics method:

I start by creating a table with some multicolumn skewed data. In the new table T, FLAG1 and FLAG2 are columns that have only two values: Y and N. The way Iï¿½ve generated the data, however, ensures that almost all rows are created with FLAG1 <> FLAG2 (FLAG1 is not equal to FLAG2) and very few rows are created where FLAG1 = FLAG2. FLAG1 and FLAG2 values are each uniformly distributedï¿½50 percent of FLAG1 and FLAG2 values are Y, and the other 50 percent are N. However, when you look at the values togetherï¿½as a pairï¿½a very definite data skew appears, as shown in Listing 4.

Code Listing 4: Creating a new table T and a new data skew

As you can see, in the new table T, out of 1,000,000 records, only 2,000 are such that FLAG1 = FLAG2. For the vast majority of the records, FLAG1 <> FLAG2. But pretend for a moment that you are the optimizer and are asked to calculate how many rows would come back from a predicate WHERE FLAG1 = ï¿½Nï¿½ AND FLAG2 = ï¿½Nï¿½. What math would you go through to estimate that? You have all the default statistics: number of rows in the table, number of distinct values in every column, and so on. Now what estimated cardinality would you come up with? (Remember, you are the optimizer! You did not see the table getting created.)

 As you can see, there is that magic 8,168 number in the ROWS column. The optimizer assumes that the collection returned by this function is going to have more than 8,000 entriesï¿½you can imagine how that might affect the choices made by the optimizer regarding whether to use an index when processing a query

--Active Session History : By Arup Nanda
--
--
Looking at performance issues in old sessions is easy with an Oracle Database feature called Active Session History. Note that the use of Active Session History requires Oracle Diagnostics Pack, a licensed option of Oracle Database available since Oracle Database 10g Release 1. 

Here are a few of the important columns of the V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY view:

SAMPLE_ID. The unique identifier of the Active Session History record.
SAMPLE_TIME. When Active Session History captured this data on all active sessions.
USER_ID. The numerical user ID (not the username) of the database user who created this session.
SESSION_ID. The session ID (SID) of the session.
SESSION_STATE. The state the session was in when Active Session History took the sample. It shows WAITING if the session was waiting for something; otherwise, it shows ON CPU to indicate that the session was doing productive work.
EVENT. If the session was in a WAITING state (in the SESSION_STATE column), this column will show the wait event the session was waiting for.
TIME_WAITED. If the session was in a WAITING state, this column will show how long it had been waiting when Active Session History took the sample.
WAIT_TIME. If the session is doing productive workï¿½not in a WAITING stateï¿½this column will show how long the session waited for the last wait event.
SQL_ID. The ID of the SQL statement the session was executing at the time the sample was taken.
SQL_CHILD_NUMBER. The child number of the cursor. If this is the only version of the cursor, the child number will be 0.

To begin the identification, you need to pose two questions to the application owners or users executing the SQL statements that experienced slow performance: 

Which username was used to connect to the database?
What was the time interval (start and end times) of the period when the performance issues occurred? 

select user_id from dba_users where username = 'ARUP'; -- 92
        
select session_id, sample_time, session_state, event, wait_time, time_waited, sql_id, sql_child_number CH#
from v$active_session_history
where user_id = 92
and sample_time between
    to_date('29-SEP-12 04.55.00 PM','dd-MON-yy hh:mi:ss PM')
       and
    to_date('29-SEP-12 05.05.00 PM','dd-MON-yy hh:mi:ss PM')
order by session_id, sample_time;

Because Active Session History collects information on all active sessions, you need to order the output by SID, which identifies a session (shown under SESSION_ID), and then by the collection time 



SESSION_ID SAMPLE_TIME             SESSION_STATE   EVENT                          WAIT_TIME  TIME_WAITED SQL_ID        CH#

The first row of the output. It shows that the session identified by SESSION_ID 39 was waiting for the ï¿½enq: TX - row lock contentionï¿½ event on 29-SEP-12 at 04.55.02.379 PM. Because the session was in a WAITING state, the value of the WAIT_TIME column is irrelevant, so it shows up as 0. Because the session was still in a WAITING state when Active Session History captured the state, the TIME_WAITED column shows 0. When the session finally got the lock, it could do what it had to do and stopped waiting. At that point, the total time the session had waited was updated in Active Session History (Row logged at 39 29-SEP-12 05.16.52.078) 1,310,761,160 microseconds (shown in the TIME_WAITED column), or about 22 minutes.

Now turn your attention to session 44. you can see that session 44 switched between waiting (shown under SESSION_STATE as WAITING) and doing productive work (shown as ON CPU). You need to know why the session was intermittently waiting for this wait event and therefore slowing down.

The ï¿½resmgr:cpu quantumï¿½ event is due to Oracle Databaseï¿½s Database Resource Management feature. Database Resource Management acts as a resource governor: it limits CPU consumption of individual sessions when the total CPU demand from all sessions goes up to more than 100 percent, and it enables more-important sessions to get the CPU they need. Because the output shows the session waiting, you can conclude that the CPU consumption by the session with SESSION_ID 44 was high enough at that time for Database Resource Management to limit its CPU usage.

In that case, you may suspect that the session was under a consumer group that has a more restrictive CPU allocation than expected.

This could have happened due to one of the three most likely reasons: a DBA manually activated a different resource plan, a different plan was activated automatically by a scheduling mechanism,

Now you should examine why the OTHER_GROUPS consumer group was activated earlier and, perhaps more importantly, whether this restriction was necessary or just a mistake. In any case, you have now found the root cause of the wait.

The next obvious question is why session 44 consumed so much CPU that it had to be constrained by Database Resource Management. The answer lies in the SQL statement that session 44 was executing at that time (not now).

--Beginning Performance Tuning: Trace Your Steps By Arup Nanda
--
--
The above tuning techniques do not, however, show the timing of individual queries or the different execution steps in each query. To display those details, you need to trace the session. Tracing is the action of enabling a flag in Oracle Database that instructs the database to write the details of the activities inside a session to a text file on the server.

There are many ways you can enable tracing in sessions, but the easiest is to use the Oracle-provided and -recommended DBMS_MONITOR package.

To start the session trace, you first need to know the unique identifiers of the session: the SID and the serial#. Use the following query to find these identifiers in the v$session view:

select sid, serial# from v$session where username = 'SH';

begin
  dbms_monitor.session_trace_enable (
    session_id => <SID>, 
    serial_num => <serial#>, 
    waits      => true, 
    binds      => true
    plan_stat  => 'all_executions');
end;

Script to identify the trace file
select
   r.value                                ||'\diag\rdbms\ '||
   sys_context('USERENV','DB_NAME')       ||'\ '||
   sys_context('USERENV','INSTANCE_NAME') ||'\trace\ '||
   sys_context('USERENV','DB_NAME')       ||'_ora_'||p.spid||'.trc'
   as tracefile_name
from v$session s, v$parameter r, v$process p
where r.name = 'diagnostic_dest'
and s.sid = &1
and p.addr = s.paddr;

tkprof ann1_ora_11408.trc ann1_ora_11408.out sys=no waits=yes  aggregate=no width=180

If the query is executed twice then that will be captured twice in the raw trace file. The tkprof tool, by default, consolidates the metrics of both executions of a specific SQL statement into a single value. Thatï¿½s why I included the AGGREGATE=NO parameter, which caused each occurrence of the query to be recorded separately in the output file.

ELAPSED. The total time of the call, including CPU. (This is the directly observable metric. The greater the elapsed time, the more time the session is taking.)
CPU. The total CPU time of the call.
QUERY. How many blocks were accessed (queried) by the call (whether from disk or buffer cache).
DISK. How many of those queried blocks came from the disk.

In the above example the DISK column value is shown as 0, meaning that the query got all of its blocks from the buffer cache without needing to go to the physical disk. The QUERY column shows the number of rows retrieved at that stage. In this case, three rows were retrieved.

SQL>  exec dbms_monitor.serv_mod_act_trace_disable('SYS$USERS', 'SQL*Plus', dbms_monitor.all_actions);

Using TRCSESS to aggregate your trace files

When you use a client_id trace, or procedure which can generate more than one trace file you will have to aggregate the files in order to analyze them all at the same time. This is the purpose of the TRCSESS utility.

trcsess  [output=output_file_name]
         [session=session_id]
         [clientid=client_id]
         [service=service_name]
         [action=action_name]
         [module=module_name]
         [trace_files]

If I need to aggregate the traces I made for the client_id ï¿½this is a testï¿½, Iï¿½ll use the following syntaxe

trcsess output=mytracefile.trc clientid='this is a test' *.trc
tkprof mytracefile.trc mytraceoutput.log

-----------------------------
APEX Guidelines

Thereï¿½s a certain comfort in that: you have total control, and anything and everything that happens in the application is reflected right there in the characters you typedï¿½and can change.

The downside of 100 percent coding for applications is that developers are generally much less productive and the resulting code is much less structured than application code developed with a RAD framework, such as Oracle Application Express (or Oracle JDeveloper). A framework means that you cannot help but build your application according to the rules and formats supported by the framework

Therefore, I am happy to trade off some loss of control for dramatic improvements in productivity and maintainability. When a framework can do a lot of work for you

I suggest following these guidelines when writing PL/SQL code in Oracle Application Express applications: 

The only SQL statements you should write in the Application Builder (the Oracle Application Express UI for building applications) are queries to populate reports and tables. Even then, you should simplify those queries as much as possible through use of views and, for some complex scenarios, table functions.
Avoid repetition of code whenever possible. This advice is not specific to Oracle Application Express; it is one of the most important guidelines for high-quality programming overall.
Keep the volume of code inside the Oracle Application Express application to a minimum. Move as much code as possible to PL/SQL packages.

Condition on the Reviewer Actions region

   l_dummy   CHAR (1);

    WHERE     dr.user_id = :ai_user_id
          AND dr.domain_reviewer_id = qr.domain_reviewer_id
          AND qr.question_id = :p659_question_id;

   RETURN TRUE;

   WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND
   THEN
      RETURN FALSE;
   WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS
   THEN
      RETURN TRUE;
END;

codes like this should be moved into the package  IS_REVIEWER_OR_AUTHOR .

FUNCTION is_reviewer_or_author
   RETURN BOOLEAN
IS
   l_dummy       CHAR (1);
   l_author_id   PLS_INTEGER;
BEGIN
   SELECT 'x'
     INTO l_dummy
     FROM qdb_question_reviews qr, qdb_domain_reviewers_v dr
    WHERE     dr.user_id = v ('ai_user_id')
          AND dr.domain_reviewer_id = qr.domain_reviewer_id
          AND qr.question_id = v ('p659_question_id');

   RETURN TRUE;
EXCEPTION
   WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND
   THEN
      SELECT qu.author_id
        INTO l_author_id
        FROM qdb_questions qu
       WHERE qu.question_id = v ('p659_question_id');

      RETURN l_author_id = v ('ai_user_id');
   WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS
   THEN
      RETURN TRUE;
END; 


 And then I could call the function from Application Builder as 
IF qdb_review_mgr.is_reviewer_or_author 
THEN


There are, unfortunately, two big problems with this approach: 

1.If the name of the item ever changes, that name change will be ï¿½hiddenï¿½ behind the literal and will not be felt until testingï¿½runtime, that isï¿½instead of compile time.
2.The person maintaining the application cannot tell by looking at the function call what it is dependent on and will have to open the package body and search out the code.

IS_REVIEWER_OR_AUTHOR function as parameterized function 
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_reviewer_or_author (
   user_id_in          INTEGER,
   question_id_in   IN INTEGER)
   RETURN BOOLEAN
IS

Again, the back end of the PL/SQL Challenge application, which consists of more than 1,900 procedures and functions collected into 40 packages, offers an excellent example. One of the main packages, qdb_content (QDB, the application prefix for PL/SQL Challenge, stands for Quiz Database), manages content for quizzes. This package contains 180 procedures and functions (and the package body contains more than 6,800 lines of code
